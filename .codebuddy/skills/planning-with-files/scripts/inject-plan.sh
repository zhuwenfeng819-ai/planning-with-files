# planning-with-files: resolve the active plan, verify its attestation, and emit
# plan context for injection into the model turn.
#
# This script holds the logic that used to live inline in the UserPromptSubmit,
# PreToolUse, and PreCompact hook command scalars (v2.43 and earlier). The hooks
# now dispatch to this file via the proven self-discovery pattern, so the logic
# is versioned and testable instead of duplicated across 14 SKILL.md variants.
#
# Context modes (--context=...):
#   userprompt (default) — full plan head + progress/ledger summary. Once per turn.
#   pretool              — short plan head only (head -30), no progress.
#   precompact           — compaction reminder only (no plan body), matches v2.
#   preflight            — fixed token after cheap selection/containment checks.
#   validate             — fixed acceptance token after selection guards, no data.
#
# v3 behavior keys off explicit opt-in. With no .mode file present the output is
# byte-equivalent to the v2.43 hook scalars (legacy invariant). Autonomous and
# gated modes change the injection shape (full fidelity + structured ledger
# summary instead of raw progress.md tail; per-tool-call injection dropped).
#
# Multi-root disambiguation (issue #212): PWF_PLAN_ROOT pins the effective plan
# root for threads whose cwd is a shared parent of the real project; a
# .planning/sessions dir arms the same session-attachment guard the Codex
# adapter enforces; and an ambiguous cwd-guessed resolution refuses to inject
# when a direct child of the root carries its own competing .planning.
#
# Always exits 0. Never errors out the agent loop.

# sentinel receive plan context. Absence of the sessions dir is the legacy
# single-session case and stays byte-identical.

# Unlike the Codex adapter this branch is NOT silent, deliberately. The Codex
# adapter runs on a host that hands it a session id, so an unattached session
# there is a real choice. This script also runs on hosts that never set

# to review as well. One line per turn is the price of being diagnosable.

# --- Mode (v3 opt-in). Legacy = no .mode file = empty MODE. ---
# The .mode marker carries space-separated tokens ("autonomous", "gate"); gated
# mode is written as "autonomous gate". Do NOT collapse whitespace with
# `tr -d '[:space:]'`: that turns "autonomous gate" into "autonomousgate", which
# matches none of the autonomous|gated case branches below and silently degrades
# gated mode to legacy behavior (platform-critical: per-tool-call injection not
# suppressed, oracle re-hash skipped, raw progress tail injected). Use a grep
# token test, the same pattern check-complete.sh guard 1 uses.

# --- Root .mode is a FLOOR, not a default that slug scope replaces (#238). ---
# A project makes attestation mandatory by committing a root .mode, which is a
# reviewed project setting. Slug scope used to read ONLY the slug's .mode, and
# init-session.sh writes no .mode unless --autonomous or --gated was passed, so
# `init-session.sh <name>` produced a plan with no mode, no attestation
# requirement and full injection: one agent-invocable command turned the
# project's policy off.
#
# mode_has answers for a strictness-RAISING token: present in EITHER file. A
# slug may opt into autonomous/gated where the root left it unset; it can no
# longer opt out of what the root committed.
#
# mode_relax_allowed answers for the one strictness-LOWERING token
# (plan-guard-off): the slug must carry it AND, when the project committed a
# root .mode, that file must carry it too. A slug alone cannot switch off a
# protection the project kept on.
#
# With no root .mode present ROOT_MODE_FILE is either empty (root scope) or
# names a missing file, so the effective token set is exactly the slug's and

# --- Parallel-write guard (v3.10.0, issue #217). ---
# Two sessions sharing one plan directory can both write task_plan.md from the
# same read: the later write silently discards the earlier one's work, and
# nothing notices (injection, plan-doctor and the Stop gate all read the
# clobbered file as an ordinary edit). Attestation does not cover this. It
# compares against a baseline a human approved once, it reports a collaborator's
# edit with the same [PLAN TAMPERED] wording as a hostile rewrite, and it is a
# read-side gate that cannot stop the stale write from landing.
#
# Comparing the raw hash against "what the hooks last saw" would flag a single
# agent's own edit on its very next fire, which is most fires. This compares
# PROGRESS instead: checked boxes and completed phases only go up during normal
# work, so a DECREASE between two fires means work that was on disk is gone.
# Forward motion stays silent, which is what keeps the signal worth reading.
# Both markers are language-neutral: every translated template keeps the literal
# English "**Status:** complete" token because check-complete.sh matches it with
# grep -F.
#
# Advisory only, and userprompt only. This script contracts to always exit 0,
# and no PreToolUse deny path exists on any supported host, so the guard reports
# the loss it can see rather than pretending to prevent it.
#
# Default-on everywhere, including legacy, and that is a deliberate narrow
# exception to the "no .mode file means byte-identical output to v2.43"
# invariant above. Arming it only in a v3 mode would arm it exactly where it is
# redundant and leave it off where the bug bites: a v3 mode refuses to inject an
# UNATTESTED plan at all (NEEDS_ATTEST, above), and an ATTESTED one already
# reports an outside edit as TAMPERED, so the unprotected population is legacy,
# which is also the default. The invariant exists so the injected plan payload
# stays stable turn over turn, not so that destroyed work stays silent, and this
# line appears only when work was destroyed. PWF_PLAN_GUARD=0 or a
# "plan-guard-off" token in .mode restores the old silence.
#
# ponytail: the marker is keyed on the plan path, not the session, so the
# warning reaches whichever session fires next rather than specifically the one
# holding the stale copy. Per-session keying needs PWF_SESSION_ID, which most
