# planning-with-files: lock the current task_plan.md content with a SHA-256 attestation.
#
# Use after you finalise (or intentionally edit) a plan. The hooks then refuse
# to inject plan content into the model context if the file diverges from the
# attested hash, surfacing a "[PLAN TAMPERED]" warning instead.
#
# Resolution:
#   1. --target root or <plan-id> → root or named plan under $PWF_PLAN_ROOT (default: cwd)
#   2. $PLAN_ID env var → ./.planning/$PLAN_ID/
#   3. ./.planning/.active_plan
#   4. Newest ./.planning/<dir>/ by mtime
#   5. Current directory when it is .planning/<valid-slug>/
#   6. Legacy ./task_plan.md at project root
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/attest-plan.sh         # attest the active plan
#   sh scripts/attest-plan.sh --show  # print the stored hash
#   sh scripts/attest-plan.sh --clear # remove the attestation (re-open the plan)
#   sh scripts/attest-plan.sh --target root      # attest the legacy root plan
#   sh scripts/attest-plan.sh --target <plan-id> # attest one named plan
