# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [3.24.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- Native Qoder CLI plugin with the canonical planning skill, seven lifecycle hooks and the opt-in completion gate (PR #313). The launcher supports Python 3.10+ through Bash, isolates Python startup and excludes relative executable search paths. The adapter translates gated Stop into Qoder CLI's exit-code-2 contract. Claude-specific command prompts are excluded; Qoder IDE hook behavior remains unverified.

### Fixed
- Claude Code plugin and standalone skill hooks suppress unchanged PreToolUse plan views after successful prompt injection. A changed visible view refreshes once, with separate state for sessions, agents, plans and rendering modes. Recovery resets the state even when the plan is temporarily absent. Missing identity or an unsafe or unavailable cache preserves repeated injection; `PWF_PRETOOL=always` opts into per-call context. Selection, snapshot and attestation checks still run before suppression (#312).

### Security
- File-only SessionStart recovery now starts its catch-up child with isolated Python startup, matching the parent hook's import policy and preventing `PYTHONPATH` startup code from loading in that child.

### Thanks
- calm (@shouldnotappearcalm), for the Qoder plugin integration and lifecycle tests (PR #313).
- @mfehlhaber, for reproducing repeated plan injection and specifying its recovery cases (#312), and for the earlier report that established the maintained npm package route (#213).

## [3.23.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added
- A public file-only recovery fixture with a halfway checkpoint, completed reference task, receipt template and standard-library grader. File-only, baseline and replay trials are scored separately; explicitly inconclusive receipts stay out of the file-only tally. Historical recovery measurements remain labeled as historical (#303, PR #310).

### Fixed
- `dsh-planning-with-files` 1.0.1 stamps the producer-owned `plugin:planning-with-files` source required by DSH V4, while recognizing queued legacy messages for deduplication. The DSH development dependencies form a consistent V4 test baseline and the regression checks every injection route (#306, PR #309).
- Manual `/plan-goal` and topic-handoff instructions use the installed resolver, refuse invalid pins and ambiguous selection, and handle its empty legacy-root result explicitly (#300, PR #304).
- The Codex opt-out guide describes the registered Python `PreToolUse` adapter's successful silent exit with `PLANNING_DISABLED=1` (#302, PR #308).

### Thanks
- @as992949791, for correcting manual plan-selection instructions (PR #304).
- Shaun Lin (@ShaunLinTW), for correcting the Codex opt-out guide (PR #308).
- Jin Zhengyu (@shuoxuekeji), for the DSH V4 source and regression fix (PR #309).
- @Jinzy, for reporting the DSH failure and submitting the fix (#306, PR #309).
- Matt Van Horn (@mvanhorn), for the public file-only recovery fixture (PR #310).

## [3.22.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added
- OpenCode 2 support in `opencode-planning-with-files` 1.2.0. A default plugin definition registers native context injection, write reminders, compaction context, planning tools and the idle completion gate. The same package retains the OpenCode 1 server entry and named factory (#298).

### Fixed
- OpenCode 2 sessions that move to another project or subdirectory resolve their new planning files on every hook, keeping context and planning tools in agreement. Plugin unload and failed setup dispose registrations and stop the event subscription.
- OpenCode installation instructions distinguish the v2 `plugins` key from the v1 `plugin` key and explain the default export required by local v2 wrappers.

### Thanks
- @luyanfeng, for reporting the OpenCode 2 plugin loading failure (#298).

## [3.21.0] - 2026-09-27

### Added
- `attest-plan.sh --target root` attests the project roadmap while a named plan remains active. `--target <plan-id>` selects a named plan through the existing resolver, honors `PWF_PLAN_ROOT`, and rejects invalid or linked targets without falling back. Attestation writes print the resolved plan and hash-file paths first (#296, PR #297).

### Fixed
- PowerShell named-plan initialization retries the transient active-pointer pre-check failure that can occur during a concurrent replacement. Every retry retains the root and pointer safety checks, and attempts remain bounded (#294, PR #295).
- Explicit attestation targets reject empty values and unsupported trailing arguments. Named targets preserve containment checks and normalize validated Windows paths before hashing (#296, PR #297).

### Thanks
- @tayfuryldz, for the PowerShell pre-check retry and explicit attestation target, with regression coverage (#294, #296, PRs #295 and #297).

## [3.20.8] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed
- The automatic Stop check is silent when no plan exists. In every Claude Code session without a `task_plan.md`, each reply ended with "No task_plan.md found" because the no-plan branch of `check-complete --gate` printed its notice and the hook surfaced it as a system message. The gate path now exits quietly there, and the explicit report (`check-complete` without `--gate`) keeps the notice (#288, PR #289).
- PowerShell active-pointer replacement names its own backup file for `ReplaceFile`. When the final replacement fails after the old pointer was moved aside, the selector moves it back, or deletes only its own backup when another selector has already written a safe pointer. It no longer leaves an unowned `.active_plan~RF*.TMP` behind and never deletes one it did not create. After a successful switch the backup only holds the superseded value, so it is deleted without being moved back, and a backup that cannot be removed produces a warning instead of a failed exit for a pointer that was already written (#254, PR #290).
- Cursor hooks follow Cursor's current hook schema. Cursor has no `userPromptSubmit` event, so the plan was never injected; plan context now arrives through `sessionStart` `additional_context`. `preToolUse` answers `{"permission":"allow"}`, the progress reminder is returned as `postToolUse` `additional_context`, failure paths print valid JSON, and the Windows manifest starts PowerShell with `-NoProfile`. The shell session-start hook runs Python in isolated mode and falls back from `python3` to `python`. Cursor Cloud Agents do not run `sessionStart` (#262, PR #291).
- Gemini CLI hooks use the output fields Gemini reads. Plan context moves from `BeforeTool`, whose `systemMessage` is shown only to the user, and `BeforeModel`, whose top-level `additionalContext` is ignored, to `BeforeAgent` `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`; the `AfterTool` reminder moves into `hookSpecificOutput` as well. The skill metadata lists the registered events (#292, PR #293).
- The Cursor and Gemini hook scripts are executable. Gemini runs each hook as `bash -c <path>` and Cursor requires executable script hooks, but the four Gemini hooks and the Cursor `pre-tool-use`, `post-tool-use` and `stop` hooks were committed as 100644, so they could not run from a macOS or Linux clone. A test now checks the git mode of every script the two manifests run by path. On macOS and Linux this also turns on the documented Cursor stop hook: while the root plan has incomplete phases it asks Cursor to continue, at most three times per stop (`loop_limit`), without a `.mode` opt-in, as the Windows route already did.
- The Cursor stop hook is silent when every phase is complete. Cursor submits a stop hook's `followup_message` as the next user message, and the hook returned an "ALL PHASES COMPLETE" message for a finished plan, so each stop in such a project triggered up to three automatic follow-up turns on the Windows route. An incomplete plan still asks Cursor to continue.

### Changed
- Projects that copied the Cursor or Gemini adapters need the new manifest together with the new scripts: `.cursor/hooks.json` and `.cursor/hooks.windows.json` register `sessionStart` with `session-start.sh` or `session-start.ps1`, and `.gemini/settings.json` registers `BeforeAgent` with `before-agent.sh`, which replaces `before-tool.sh` and `before-model.sh`.

### Thanks
- @mmychu, for tracing the per-reply Stop notice to the no-plan branch of `check-complete --gate` and fixing every copy (#288, PR #289).
- @kuei51307-hub, for the caller-owned `ReplaceFile` backup with pointer recovery and its failure-path regression (#254, PR #290).
- @SomSamantray, for moving the Cursor hooks to the current schema (#262, PR #291).
- @ShaunLinTW, for reporting and fixing the Gemini hook output schema (#292, PR #293).

## [3.20.7] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed
- The npm package description now discloses selected project planning context and the absence of a network upload path. This restores the public-capability metadata check that failed in v3.20.6 CI.
- The contributor portrait grid uses the current profile for @Fat-Jan and stable identicons linked to archived credits for two unavailable accounts.
- The full npm README points to the v3.20.7 repository files and includes the corrected contributor portraits.

## [3.20.6] - 2026-09-23

### Added
- The README ends with a linked portrait grid of credited contributors, excluding the maintainer.

### Fixed
- Phase-status locking now grants ownership through exclusive `.owner` creation instead of relying on `mkdir` exit status. This prevents a lost update when a Windows-native `mkdir` reports success to two writers (#281, PR #282).
- Hermes rejects linked active-plan pointers and replaces the pointer through an exclusive temporary file, preserving hard-linked sibling content (#259, PR #284).
- OpenCode and the DSH core reject linked active-plan pointers and replace the pointer without truncating a hard-linked sibling. A linked `.planning` directory is rejected while a project root reached through a junction remains usable (#260, PR #283).
- PowerShell named-plan initialization rejects a read-only active pointer before creating the new plan directory (#253, PR #285).
- PowerShell initialization recovers a project working directory containing `[` or `]` under Windows PowerShell 5.1 (#256, PR #286).
- PowerShell active-pointer replacement retries transient concurrent I/O and pointer-inspection races while rechecking root and pointer safety. Cleanup of a `ReplaceFile` artifact after final failure remains open in #254 (PR #287).

### Changed
- The `planning-with-files` npm package ships the canonical skill and displays the full official repository README. Repository-relative images and document links resolve to the v3.20.6 release while the Pi integration remains bundled.

### Thanks
- @kuei51307-hub, for the exclusive phase-status lock claim and regression in #282.
- @TayfurYldz, for the OpenCode, DSH, Hermes and PowerShell pointer fixes in #283, #284, #285, #286 and #287.

## [3.20.5] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed
- OpenCode session replay tolerates null or array part rows, non-string tool names, and non-string text instead of aborting the session. Healthy rows remain available, and the defensive checks are synchronized across the copies that carry this formatter (#269, PR #273).
- Shell and PowerShell initialization now report failed attestation as `NOT attested`, with a reason and recovery command, instead of claiming success. Attestation failure remains non-aborting, and inherited plan selectors are restored after the attempt (#276, PR #277).
- The analytics task-plan template includes a non-empty `## Next Step` section across its shipped copies. Structural and initializer regressions keep generated analytics plans compatible with lifecycles that require that section (#278, PR #279).
- PowerShell planning-file writes fail with a non-zero exit status and an error when access is denied. Named plans become active only after all three planning files are ready, so a failed initialization preserves the previous active pointer. The separately maintained host and translated initializers also stop on write errors (#255, PR #280).

### Thanks
- @TayfurYldz, for the malformed OpenCode replay guards and regression coverage in #273.
- @kuei51307-hub, for attestation failure reporting in #277 and the analytics Next Step fix in #279.
- @ShaunLinTW, for denied-write handling, safe activation ordering, and Windows regression coverage in #280.
- @mfehlhaber, for reporting the missing analytics Next Step section in #278.

## [3.20.4] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed
- PowerShell route on OneDrive: `resolve-plan-dir.ps1`, the Cursor hook `resolve-plan-context.ps1` and `set-active-plan.ps1` refused an `.active_plan` pointer that carried the `ReparsePoint` file attribute. OneDrive Files On-Demand sets that attribute on every synced file, so in a project under OneDrive the Cursor hooks stopped with the unsafe-pointer notice instead of injecting the pointed plan, the resolver printed nothing for `attest-plan.ps1` and `check-complete.ps1`, and `set-active-plan.ps1` refused to write, while every other route read the pointer normally. The three checks now refuse a container or a `LinkType` of `SymbolicLink` or `Junction`, the predicate v3.20.3 gave the directory checks and the `[ -L ]` of the shell scripts. `attest-plan.ps1` had the same class of check in its native helper and refused to hash, show or clear any reparse-point file, so attestation failed in every project under OneDrive while `init-session.ps1` still reported the plan as attested; it now refuses only name-surrogate reparse points (symlinks, junctions and unknown surrogate tags), which is the set Windows path parsing follows (#275).
- `tests/test_session_catchup_copies_exact_basename.py` walked the whole checkout and loaded any untracked `session-catchup.py`, so a stale clone kept under the gitignored `.planning/` on a maintainer machine failed the two tests with 120 subtests while CI stayed green. The copies now come from `git ls-files`; the filtered walk is kept only for a checkout without git (#274).

## [3.20.3] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed
- A symlinked or junctioned directory under `.planning/` is never a plan, on every route that resolves plans. `inject-plan.sh` and `resolve-plan-dir.sh --check-ambiguity` counted a linked plan directory toward the several-plans rule while the Hermes plugin did not, so the shell route refused a tree that Hermes injected (#270). The counters now skip linked directories (PR #271). Skipping the link in the counter alone left the selection paths following it through containment: one real plan plus a newer linked one counted as one plan and the newest-mtime scan then selected the linked directory, the mtime guess the #240 rule exists to prevent. The shell family (`resolve-plan-dir.sh`, `inject-plan.sh`, `resolve-plan-dir.ps1`, the Python twin `inject-plan.py`) therefore refuses a linked plan directory in the `PLAN_ID`, `.active_plan` and newest-mtime branches as well; a `PLAN_ID` that names one fails closed with the existing "does not name a plan directory" notice, and a pointer that names one falls through like a stale pointer. The Codex adapter and the OpenCode and DeepSeek Harness plugin cores skip linked directories in their counters, which their selection already did. `set-active-plan.sh` and `set-active-plan.ps1` refuse to point the shared default at a linked directory and leave it out of `--list`. The link test is symlink or junction only (`[ -L ]`, `is_link`, `LinkType`), never the bare ReparsePoint attribute: OneDrive Files On-Demand marks every synced directory as a reparse point, and those stay plans. Untouched on purpose: the Pi extension keeps its armed-only containment rule, and the nested-root probes still count a linked nested plan as a conflict, which only ever refuses. Every shipped copy is synced; the sh/py parity suite, the cross-route ambiguity suite and the pointer tool suite carry the linked-directory fixture (junction on Windows, symlink elsewhere).

### Thanks
- @ShaunLinTW, for the shell counter change with the Hermes differential regression in #271.

## [3.20.2] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed
- Hermes plugin: on Hermes 0.21.3 the host rewrites the process-global `TERMINAL_CWD` to the home directory during the first turn of a CLI session (`agent/relay_runtime.py` imports `gateway/run.py` lazily, and that module's import-time bridge applies the `Path.home()` fallback for an empty or placeholder `terminal.cwd`), so `resolve_agent_cwd()` named the home directory, the hooks found no plan there and injected nothing, with no signal that the plan in the launch directory had been skipped. The rewrite runs before the first plugin hook, so the plugin cannot recover the root on its own and does not guess: when the resolved directory holds no plan and the launch directory of a CLI session does, `pre_llm_call` now injects one line naming both directories and the `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` pin instead of returning nothing, `/pwf-status` prints the same line under `No planning files found.`, `/pwf` appends it when the plan it created went somewhere other than a launch directory that already holds one, and `/pwf` and `/pwf-status` honor `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` like the hooks and report a pin that does not resolve instead of creating or reading a plan in the directory Hermes named. The line stays silent outside the CLI, in `hermes -w` worktree sessions (`TERMINAL_CWD` at `<repo>/.worktrees/<name>` without a chdir is the intended split), for a launch directory without planning state, and for a launch directory whose session isolation refuses the session. Upstream: NousResearch/hermes-agent#86411 and #95577 (#272).

### Changed
- `docs/hermes.md` documents the Hermes 0.21.3 working-directory rewrite, what was reproduced with the 0.21.0 source, the pin for project-scoped CLI sessions, and the shell-hook route as the unaffected alternative.

### Thanks
- @ericshunhinglee-cloud, for the report with the setter stack trace, the on-the-wire token evidence and the upstream cross-references in #272.

## [3.20.1] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed
- `init-session.sh`: a plan name containing a newline created `.planning/<date>-line-one<newline>line-two/`, then the selector rejected the id and init exited 1 with the directory left behind. `slugify` now maps CR and LF to `-` before the `sed` step, so the slug is a single line as in the PowerShell twin (#257).
- Both initializers bound `PLAN_ID` for the attestation call but not `PWF_PLAN_ROOT`, so a pin inherited from another project redirected or silently blocked the attestation of the plan that was just created. `init-session.sh` and `init-session.ps1` now bind `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` and `PLAN_ID` to the plan just created around the attest call in slug mode and restore the inherited values afterwards. Root mode clears both selectors for that call instead, because the attester only falls back to the legacy `./task_plan.md` when no selector is set; this also stops an inherited `PLAN_ID` from redirecting the shell attester to a sibling slug plan, as the PowerShell twin already did. Root-mode attestation for `--autonomous` and `--gated` now has regression tests on both routes (#261).
- `session-catchup.py`, OpenCode adapter: a part row whose `state` or `state.input` is not an object raised `AttributeError`, and a row whose `data` column is not valid JSON made SQLite raise `malformed JSON` for the whole session. Malformed shapes are treated as empty input and non-JSON rows are filtered with `json_valid(data)`; healthy rows in the same session are still reported. Applies to every copy that carries the adapter (#258).
- Hermes plugin: with two or more named plans under `.planning/` and no `PLAN_ID`, the plugin resolved the shared pointer or the newest plan by modification time, so two Hermes sessions on two plans in one project could be injected with each other's plan. The plugin now applies the v3.17.1 rule: `pre_llm_call` emits the one-line `Multiple plans are available` notice once per turn and injects nothing, `post_tool_call` and `pre_verify` stay quiet, and `/pwf-status`, `planning_with_files_status` and `planning_with_files_check_complete` report the missing selector. One named plan, a root plan, a `PLAN_ID` pin and the nested-root safeguards behave as before; `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` pins the project root and does not select one of several same-root plans (#264).

### Changed
- `docs/hermes.md` describes the Hermes selection rule as shipped.

### Thanks
- @ShaunLinTW, for the malformed-row guards in the OpenCode catchup adapter and their regression tests in #263.
- @TayfurYldz, for the single-line shell slug in #266 and the project-bound attestation with shell and PowerShell regressions in #265.
- @kuei51307-hub, for porting the several-plans rule into the Hermes plugin in #267.

## [3.20.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- DeepSeek Harness (DSH) becomes a first-class host through a native Cordis plugin, `dsh-planning-with-files` (npm, source in `.dsh/packages/dsh-planning-with-files/`). DSH reads the skill from `~/.agents/skills/` but ignores the `hooks:` block in SKILL.md, so the plugin carries the lifecycle: the framed plan is appended on every prompt (`agent/pre-step`) and re-injected with the compaction note after a completed compaction (`session/event`, `compaction/end`), the progress reminder follows `write`, `edit` and `str_replace_editor` mutations (`tools/post-execute`), and the completion gate holds the turn boundary in gated mode (`agent/turn-stopping`) with the shared `.stop_blocks` cap and stall detection. `/pwf [--autonomous|--gated] [--template analytics] [name]` and `/pwf-status` are registered as DSH commands, `pwf_init`, `pwf_status` and `pwf_check` as tools; DSH's own `/plan` is untouched. Install with `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-planning-with-files` and restart; the same command serves the `headless`, `sdk` and `acp` profiles. `PLAN_ID`, `PWF_PLAN_ROOT`, `PLANNING_DISABLED` and `PWF_GATE_CAP` keep their meaning. The plugin core is byte-identical to the OpenCode plugin core and a test keeps it so; a `vitest (DSH plugin)` CI job runs its suite. Guide: `docs/deepseek-harness.md` (#252).
- Cursor's native PowerShell hooks resolve named plans. `user-prompt-submit.ps1`, `pre-tool-use.ps1`, `post-tool-use.ps1` and `stop.ps1` share `resolve-plan-context.ps1`, which selects the plan through `resolve-plan-dir.ps1`: `PLAN_ID` is binding, `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` pins the project, one named plan resolves through `.active_plan` or on its own, two or more require `PLAN_ID`, and a stale pointer falls through to the root plan the way `inject-plan.sh` does. The bash hooks keep reading the root `task_plan.md` only (#251, item 9 of #250).
- `tests/test_cursor_powershell_named_plans.py` runs the Cursor contract under Windows PowerShell 5.1 and pwsh 7 when both are installed; `tests/test_powershell_literal_paths.py` covers bracketed project paths and the attester pin on 5.1.

### Fixed
- `resolve-plan-dir.ps1` failed on Windows PowerShell 5.1 whenever `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` was set: `[IO.Path]::IsPathFullyQualified` does not exist on .NET Framework, so every 5.1 route that calls the resolver aborted with a method-not-found error. A drive-qualified regex replaces it (#251). `attest-plan.ps1` carried the same call and the same fix.
- `resolve-plan-dir.ps1` tested candidate directories with wildcard-interpreting `Test-Path` and listed `.planning` with `Get-ChildItem -Path`, so a project path containing `[` or `]` resolved to nothing under pwsh, even with an explicit `PLAN_ID`. Every path test in the resolver is now literal.
- `resolve-plan-dir.ps1`, `ledger-append.ps1`, `ledger-summary.ps1` and `phase-status.ps1` raised on a zero-byte `.active_plan`, because the `[string]` cast of an empty `Get-Content -Raw` is still `$null`. An empty pointer now falls through like an invalid one.
- The OpenCode plugin (now 1.1.0) and the DSH plugin apply the v3.17.1 rule: with two or more named plans and no `PLAN_ID`, the prompt gets the `Multiple plans are available` notice and nothing is injected, instead of the shared pointer or the newest directory choosing a plan for the session (#240). `pwf_status` and `pwf_check` name the missing selector.
- Cursor PowerShell hooks: the shared context is a hashtable, so ConstrainedLanguage mode (WDAC, AppLocker) no longer turns every hook fire into "nothing injected"; hook output is sent as UTF-8, so the em-dash and non-ASCII plan text no longer arrive as `-` and `?` under the OEM code page; `pre-tool-use.ps1` prints its `{"decision": "allow"}` line from a `finally` block; a dot-named or invalid-slug directory beside a root plan no longer blocks that plan; the notices name the offending `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` or `PLAN_ID` value with the canonical wording; the `$?` guard after the resolver call is read where 5.1 actually sets it.
- `tests/test_plan_listing.py` compares the selector's error against whitespace-normalized stderr, since Windows PowerShell wraps stderr at the console width and the phrase could straddle a line break depending on the checkout path.

### Changed
- README: the five introductory blocks after the long-running table are one "The 3-file pattern" section; the Hermes section is a "First-class hosts: native plugins" table covering Claude Code, Pi, Hermes, OpenCode and DeepSeek Harness (the Hermes surface table lives in `docs/hermes.md`); the Pi, OpenCode, Hermes and DSH command tables sit in one collapsible under the Claude Code commands. Old anchors keep working.
- `docs/cursor.md` describes the PowerShell hook route as shipped: every hook file, the runtime dependency on the bundled `scripts/` directory, the selection rules, and the two deliberate differences from the Claude Code route (no session isolation, silent stop on an unresolved explicit selector).
- The v3.19.0 note that Cursor users on Windows should keep to zero-argument root mode no longer applies.

### Thanks
- @kuei51307-hub, for routing Cursor's native PowerShell hooks through the shared resolver and for the Windows PowerShell 5.1 compatibility of the resolver's pin check in #251.
- @loarland, for reporting that DeepSeek Harness ran the skill without its lifecycle hooks and offering to test, in #252.

## [3.19.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- Named-plan slug mode for `init-session.ps1`. A positional project name or `-PlanDir` creates an isolated `.planning/<date>-<slug>/` plan with collision suffixes, records the shared `.active_plan` pointer, inherits the root `.mode` policy floor, and keeps `-Template`, `-Autonomous` and `-Gated` working. Zero-argument root mode is unchanged. Attestation runs through `attest-plan.ps1` on Windows and `attest-plan.sh` elsewhere, bound to the plan that was just created; root mode ignores an inherited `PLAN_ID` while attesting (#247). Plan ids stay ASCII for names with letters that .NET folds to ASCII, plan files are written with literal paths so a project path containing `[` or `]` works under pwsh, root `.mode` inheritance is case-sensitive like the shell twin, and an empty name stays in root mode.
- `set-active-plan.sh --verify-root` and `set-active-plan.ps1 -VerifyRoot` check that the planning root is inside the project and that the shared pointer is a replaceable regular file, without listing or selecting. Both initializers run it before creating a named plan.

### Fixed
- Session catchup anchors only on exact planning filenames. A write to a lookalike such as `draft_task_plan.md` or `archive-progress.md` no longer counts as a planning update that moves the recovery window forward and hides later context. The OpenCode SQLite lookup is bounded to exact planning paths, revalidated after decoding, and iterated lazily so large write parts are not materialized. OpenCode path matching is now case-sensitive like the JSONL scanners. Applies to the canonical copies and to the Hermes, MastraCode and OpenCode adapters (#248).
- The same exact-basename rule now also covers the root `scripts/session-catchup.py` used by the Claude Code plugin and the five translated `skills/i18n` copies, which the sync tool does not maintain. A new test loads every shipped copy so the boundary cannot drift again in one of them.

### Changed
- A positional project name passed to `init-session.ps1` now creates a named plan under `.planning/` instead of writing the project root, matching `init-session.sh`. The Cursor native PowerShell hooks still read only the root `task_plan.md`, so Cursor users on Windows who want hook injection should keep using zero-argument root mode for now.

### Security
- `init-session.sh` no longer writes `.planning/.active_plan` with shell redirection in slug mode. It validates the physical planning root through `set-active-plan.sh --verify-root` before creating a plan beneath it and replaces the pointer through the selector's contained atomic update. A hardlinked pointer keeps its peer intact, a symlinked pointer is refused, and a planning root that resolves outside the project stops initialization (#249). The check runs in constant time through the selector's new verify mode before anything is created, so a refused pointer leaves no plan directory behind, the replaced pointer keeps a umask-derived mode instead of the 0600 that `mktemp` creates, and an unreadable pointer no longer aborts plan listing.
- `init-session.ps1` applies the same rule through `set-active-plan.ps1`: the planning root is verified before anything is created and the pointer is replaced atomically instead of written in place with `Set-Content`. A missing selector stops named-plan creation, matching the shell initializer.

### Thanks
- @ShaunLinTW, for the PowerShell slug-mode initializer, host-aware attestation, and the Windows PowerShell regression suite in #247.
- @kuei51307-hub, for the exact planning filename boundary across the catchup scanners in #248 and the safe active-pointer replacement in #249.

## [3.18.3] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed
- Completed plans no longer emit routine completion notices through the shared Stop gate or Codex Stop hook. Claude Code plugin and standalone skill hooks inherit this behavior from the canonical shell checker.
- Preserve completion reports from explicit checker commands without the gate flag. Incomplete-plan notices, gate decisions, recursion protection, block caps, stall diagnostics and plan selection safeguards are unchanged. Shell and PowerShell fixes are synchronized across maintained mirrors.

## [3.18.2] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed
- IDE sync verification now fails when an enabled mapping has no canonical source, reports every affected entry, and continues checking the remaining mappings. Verification remains read-only (#244).

### Security
- Run Python in isolated mode in the Codex, Gemini, and GitHub Copilot shell adapters. Project-local modules and Python environment overrides can no longer shadow standard-library imports in these calls. Explicit UTF-8 mode preserves Unicode project paths and error messages on Windows (#245).

### Thanks
- @kuei51307-hub, for missing-source detection and CLI regression coverage in #244.
- @ShaunLinTW, for isolating adapter Python calls and adding import-shadowing regression coverage in #245.

## [3.18.1] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed
- Accept a leading UTF-8 BOM in `.planning/.active_plan` when showing the current plan or listing saved plans. This restores the active marker for pointers written by Windows editors and PowerShell UTF-8 workflows. The fix ships across all canonical shell helper copies (#243).

### Thanks
- @kuei51307-hub, for the BOM compatibility fix and regression coverage in #243.

## [3.18.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added
- List saved named plans with `set-active-plan.sh --list` or PowerShell `set-active-plan.ps1 -List`. The output shows plan IDs, phase counts, and the shared default pointer without selecting a plan or attaching a session (#242).
- The canonical helpers and usage instructions ship across the supported IDE and language bundles, including OpenCode, Mastracode, and Hermes. Kiro's separate `.kiro/plan` layout is documented as outside this inventory.

### Fixed
- Count each phase once across mixed inline and explicit status formats, including the shipped translated templates. Ignore fenced examples, indented status examples, and unrelated sections.
- Support native PowerShell file invocation, empty files, and Windows PowerShell 5.1 startup from project paths containing brackets.

### Security
- Validate plan IDs and canonicalize the planning directory, listed directories, plan files, and pointer before reading. Symlink and junction paths outside the current project are rejected.
- Replace the shared pointer atomically, preserving external hardlinked files. A failed write returns an error without reporting that the plan was selected.

### Thanks
- @Dphoshoba, for the original implementation and plan-listing proposal in #242.

## [3.17.2] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed
- The native Codex plugin explicitly disables legacy command migration with `"commands": []`. Codex no longer turns the 13 top-level Claude commands into redundant `source-command-*` skills when installing the plugin. The canonical planning skill and Codex hooks remain configured, and Claude retains its commands (#241).

### Thanks
- @sunznx, for reporting the duplicate skills, tracing the fallback, and proposing the scoped manifest fix in #241.

## [3.17.1] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed
- Multiple named plans now require `PLAN_ID` even when `.planning/sessions/` does not exist. A shared `.active_plan` pointer or directory modification time can no longer silently redirect a Codex session after compaction (#240).
- Shell, PowerShell and Python selection paths refuse ambiguous plans. UserPromptSubmit explains the missing pin; per-tool and PreCompact hooks remain quiet, and Stop and attestation do not fall back to an unrelated root plan. Explicit pins, single named plans and legacy root plans remain supported.

### Thanks
- @sunznx, for the same-cwd Codex regression report and reproduction in #240.

## [3.17.0] - 2026-09-07

Every Claude Code hook fire forked about 130 processes. On Windows that took longer than the hook timeout, so the plan never reached the model. Found on the maintainer's own machine the day after 3.16.1 shipped.

### Fixed
- **The Claude Code plugin hooks timed out on Windows and Claude Code discarded the plan context.** `hooks/claude-hook.sh` answered every event by running `resolve-plan-dir.sh` and `inject-plan.sh`, and those answer by forking: `realpath`, `stat`, `sha256sum`, `awk`, `tr`, `mktemp`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `wc`, four separate Python starts, and a `$(...)` around most of them. One UserPromptSubmit fire forks about 130 times, one PreToolUse fire about 60. On Linux and macOS a fork costs one to three milliseconds and nobody noticed. Under Git Bash on Windows a fork costs about 90 ms, so a prompt paid 7 to 12 seconds against the 10 second hook timeout ("UserPromptSubmit hook timed out after 10s - output discarded"), and every Bash, Read, Grep and Edit call waited 5 more seconds in PreToolUse before it ran. Measured on the reporting machine: UserPromptSubmit 8.1 s, 10.2 s and 7.1 s across three fires, PreToolUse 5.5 s. The Codex route never had this because its Windows launcher starts Python directly.
- **The events now run in one Python process.** New `scripts/inject-plan.py` is a byte-identical twin of `inject-plan.sh` plus the dispatcher logic of `claude-hook.sh` for session-start, user-prompt-submit, pre-tool-use, post-tool-use and pre-compact. The launcher finds a CPython 3 on PATH with a fork-free walk (absolute entries only, Microsoft Store aliases skipped, `python3` preferred over `python` across the whole PATH) and runs the twin with `python -I -B`. The twin exits 0 only when its stdout is the complete answer; any other status falls through to the unchanged shell chain, so a host without Python, or with a Python 2 `python`, behaves exactly as before. `PWF_FAST_PATH=0` forces the shell chain. The Stop event stays in the shell because it must forward Claude's stdin payload to `gate-stop.sh`. Same machine after the change: UserPromptSubmit 0.33 s, PreToolUse 0.28 to 0.37 s, PostToolUse 0.26 s, SessionStart 0.31 s.
- **The standalone skill route takes the same fast path once a plan is accepted.** `skill-hook.sh` keeps the preflight and the refusal notices on the shell chain, because that route is pinned never to start an interpreter for a disabled or plan-less state, and runs the four injector calls after eligibility through the twin. Its interpreter discovery is the same fork-free PATH walk instead of two `$(command -v ...)` forks plus a `-c` version probe.
- **A directory with no planning state answers before any fork.** Both dispatchers exit at once when the cwd has no `task_plan.md`, no `.planning` and no `PLAN_ID` or `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` selector: every route answers with nothing there, and the reference chain took about ten forks to say so. A set selector still gets its refusal notice.
- **Both routes share one cache slot per plan.** The launchers hand the twin the shell's own `$PWD` spelling (`PWF_SHELL_PWD`, excluded from MSYS path conversion), so a fast-path fire and a fallback fire derive the same turn-marker slot (#239) and the same progress-guard slot (#217). Without that, Git Bash spelled the directory `/tmp/...` and Python `C:\Users\...`, and a switch between routes nudged twice in one turn and lost the guard's baseline.
- **Characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane survive the plugin's JSON encoder on Windows.** The `awk` walk in `json_string` used UTF-16 units under a UTF-8 locale and re-emitted an emoji in a plan as a lone surrogate, which is not UTF-8. Both dispatchers now run that walk under `LC_ALL=C`, byte by byte.

### Security
- **Hook interpreters run in isolated mode.** The `python -` heredocs and `-c` snippets in `inject-plan.sh`, `resolve-plan-dir.sh` and `skill-hook.sh` put the current directory first on `sys.path`, so a repository carrying its own `secrets.py`, `hashlib.py` or `ctypes.py` had that file imported by the hook on every prompt, with the hook's privileges. Every interpreter start in those three scripts and in the new twin now passes `-I`. A parity test plants six such modules in a project and asserts that neither route runs them and both still inject the plan. The Codex, Gemini and GitHub Copilot shell adapters still start their interpreters in default mode; that is the next item.

### Verification
- `tests/test_inject_plan_python_parity.py` runs the shell reference and the twin over the same fixtures, each with its own cache root, and asserts identical stdout bytes: every injector context, every dispatcher event, notices and refusals, frame digests and truncation flags, the progress-regression guard across three fires, smart extraction on CRLF and inline status markers, attestation, autonomous and gated modes with ledgers, the root `.mode` floor, session isolation with legacy and digest sentinels, and nested-root ambiguity. Launcher tests prove the fast path is the one that runs, that a twin which cannot run falls back to the reference output, that a missing twin falls back, that Stop never takes the fast path, and that Microsoft Store aliases and relative PATH entries are never selected.
- A second-model review of the twin against the shell chain found five real divergences before release, all fixed and each now pinned by a parity fixture: a NUL byte in `.active_plan` (command substitution drops it, so a UTF-16LE pointer without a BOM still names its plan), the awk quirk that prints `phases: /3 complete` for a plan with no completed phase, the CRLF progress tail under Git for Windows' sed, the cache-slot spelling above, and the surrogate corruption above. Three accepted differences remain and are documented in the twin's header: glob collation order in the nested-ambiguity list, BSD sed appending a newline to a progress file whose last line has none, and the spelling of a `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` pin in notices under Git Bash.

### Changed
- `scripts/inject-plan.py` ships in every scripts directory that ships `inject-plan.sh` (the sync inventory, the `.agents` mirror, the npm package and the language variants), and the canonical and location parity tests pin it.
- Version parity advances to 3.17.0.

## [3.16.1] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed
- The Claude plugin and standalone hook JSON encoders now preserve literal backslashes under POSIX awk, including Windows paths and text containing a literal `\n` sequence.
- Attached Codex, Hermes and Pi sessions could follow another task's shared `.active_plan` pointer. When session isolation is armed and multiple plans exist, these routes and the shared standalone hooks now require `PLAN_ID`. An attachment no longer bypasses nested-root ambiguity checks.
- Standalone skill PreToolUse and PostToolUse messages were emitted as plain stdout, which Claude Code does not deliver to the model for those events. A shared helper now reads the native JSON session identity and emits `additionalContext`, respects opt-out and rejected selectors, and throttles the progress reminder per turn with a private cache.
- The native Codex PostToolUse adapter dropped the session ID before writing its reminder marker, while UserPromptSubmit used the real ID to clear it. Both operations now address the same session entry.
- Installed packages were missing the advertised loop template, and six IDE bundles lacked the Stop dispatcher. The sync inventory now ships the complete dependency chain. Standalone documentation links resolve outside the repository layout.
- Recovery instructions now read and initialize files in the selected task directory, preserve existing files, and assign one orchestrator to shared planning summaries across the maintained hook-bearing variants.

### Changed
- Security guidance describes local hash attestation as a digest check while the saved digest remains trusted, not proof of human approval or protection against a writer replacing both files. The write guard is advisory and does not lock, merge or detect every overwritten summary.
- PreCompact documentation identifies its output as diagnostic. Claude Code does not support `additionalContext` for that event, so it cannot force a model to flush progress before compaction.
- Version parity advances to 3.16.1; the native Hermes plugin advances to 0.2.1 and the Pi extension to 1.2.6.

### Thanks
- @hzura and @wangxiaodong1021, for the parallel-session discussion and crossover reports in #50.
- @sortakool, for the model-context delivery report in #239 that led to checking the standalone route and native session cache.
- @oaabahussain, for the plan-content trust-boundary discussion in #150.

## [3.16.0] - 2026-09-03

The PostToolUse progress reminder was addressed to Claude and delivered to the user instead, on every matching tool call, with `Bash` in the matcher. Reported by @sortakool in #239, filed shortly after #236 to #238 and fixed on its own.

### Fixed
- **The PostToolUse nudge never reached the model (closes #239, reported by @sortakool).** `hooks/claude-hook.sh:110` emitted "Update progress.md with what you just did" as `systemMessage`, which Claude Code documents as a warning shown to the user. So the person saw the instruction after every `Write`, `Edit` and `Bash` call and the model, which the sentence is written for, never saw it once. `emit_session_start` eleven lines above already emitted `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` for its own event, so the correct shape was in the same file the whole time. Both the plugin dispatcher and `.codex/hooks/post_tool_use.py` now emit `additionalContext` with `"hookEventName": "PostToolUse"`; the Codex adapter's `pre_tool_use.py` and `run_sh.py` already used that shape for their events.
- **The nudge is now once per turn rather than once per tool call.** The string is a constant, so every repeat after the first carries no information: it names no tool, no file and no phase. UserPromptSubmit and SessionStart fire once per turn and clear a marker; the first post-tool fire of the turn sets it. The marker lives in the user's private cache under `pwf-turn/`, never in the plan directory, and is keyed on the plan path plus `PWF_SESSION_ID` so two sessions sharing a plan do not silence each other. A cache root that cannot be created skips the throttle rather than the reminder, so a broken cache cannot quietly remove it.
- **`Bash` came off the PostToolUse matchers.** `ls`, `git status` and `grep` were tripping a "you changed something, record it" reminder. `hooks/hooks.json` goes to `Write|Edit` and both Codex manifests go to `apply_patch|Edit|Write`. PreToolUse keeps `Bash`: a plan reminder before a shell command is a different and wanted behavior. The standalone skill route already used `Write|Edit`, which is further evidence the wider matcher was drift rather than intent.
- **The plugin dispatcher still had the #237 fallback.** `active_plan_dir()` in `hooks/claude-hook.sh` resolves through the shared resolver and then fell back to the legacy root `task_plan.md`, the fallback v3.15.0 removed from the script and Codex routes but not from this one. Found while fixing #239. A rejected `PLAN_ID` or `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` now stops there too.

### Verification
- 10 new tests in `tests/test_post_tool_nudge.py`, driving both routes as processes. Coverage includes the field, the once-per-turn behavior through a real re-arm, session-start as a second re-arm, two session ids not silencing each other, a broken cache root still emitting, and every matcher in all three manifests.
- One test earns its place by proving key agreement through deletion: the two Codex scripts derive the marker key independently and one of them resolves a `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` pin while the other does not. A divergence there would leave the marker uncleared and silently degrade the nudge to once per session, so the re-arm is asserted to remove the exact file the throttle wrote.

### Not changed
- The standalone skill route emits the same sentence as plain stdout from a YAML frontmatter scalar, with no throttle. It already carries the narrower `Write|Edit` matcher, so the spam this issue is about never applied to it, and giving it the throttle means either embedding cache-key logic in a hook scalar or routing it through a new script context across eleven SKILL.md files. Both are real changes that belong in a release where they can be tested on their own rather than appended to a fix.
- `FileChanged` was suggested in the issue as a way to catch a `Bash` command that rewrites a file. It is a new event surface with its own behavior and is deliberately left for its own release.

### Thanks
- Raymond, for tracing all three defects to the line and checking the Codex route before filing, and for confirming there was no user-side workaround rather than leaving it to be guessed at (#239).

## [3.15.0] - 2026-09-02

Three selector and policy defects reported by @sortakool, all reproduced here before any code changed. Two of them let a session work on a plan nobody selected, and the third made the diagnostic that should have caught them report PASS. A minor rather than a patch because two behaviors change on purpose: a `PLAN_ID` that does not resolve now refuses instead of picking another plan, and a slug plan can no longer start below a project's committed `.mode`.

### Security
- **A `PLAN_ID` that named no directory attested and injected a different plan at rc=0 (closes #237, reported by @sortakool).** `commands/plan-attest.md` has promised since v3.9.0 that an explicit selector which does not resolve exits with an error and never falls back to another plan. The `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` half held. The `PLAN_ID` half did not: `resolve_from_env` returned 1 both when no selector was set and when the selector was rejected, so a one-character typo fell through to `.active_plan`, then to newest-by-mtime, and `attest-plan.sh` locked that other plan without a word. The guard in `attest-plan.sh` written for exactly this case was unreachable, because the resolver never returned empty. A non-empty `PLAN_ID` is now a binding in every resolver: it resolves or it stops, whether it was rejected for slug shape, for naming no directory, or for failing containment. An empty value still means unset. Fixed in `resolve-plan-dir.sh`, `resolve-plan-dir.ps1`, the inline resolver inside `inject-plan.sh`, the three PowerShell helpers that carry their own, and the Hermes, OpenCode and Pi plugin resolvers.
- **A slug plan with no `.mode` bypassed the project's root `.mode` (closes #238, reported by @sortakool).** A project makes attestation mandatory by committing a root `.mode`, which is a reviewed project setting. `inject-plan.sh` read the slug's `.mode` and never the root's, and `init-session.sh` writes no `.mode` unless `--autonomous` or `--gated` was passed, so `init-session.sh <name>`, which `/plan` runs, produced a plan with no attestation requirement and full injection. The project's policy was a flag the agent chose at plan creation. The root `.mode` is now a floor: strictness-raising tokens count from either file, so a slug may raise but never lower, and the one strictness-lowering token, `plan-guard-off`, needs the root's agreement. The same floor applies to the completion gate in `check-complete.sh` and `check-complete.ps1`, which read `.mode` the same way and had the same bypass. `init-session.sh` also seeds a new slug from the root `.mode` so the effective policy is visible in the plan directory, not only in the resolver.
- **Every consumer that reads or writes the selected plan now refuses a rejected selector instead of falling back to the cwd.** `check-complete.sh` would have reported the root plan's completion state, which decides whether an autonomous run may stop; `ledger-summary.sh` would have fed the loop another plan's phase counts; `phase-status.sh` and `ledger-append.sh` would have written into a plan the operator never named. Each says which selector refused rather than going quietly dark.
- **The five Codex hooks had the same fallback.** They call the shared resolver directly rather than `inject-plan.sh`, so they inherited the refusal but then fell through to the legacy root `task_plan.md`: `stop.sh` would have decided whether the run may stop from the wrong plan, and `pre-compact.sh` would have carried the wrong plan through the one moment a session cannot re-read it. All five now stop, and `user-prompt-submit.sh`, which fires once per turn, prints the same notice as `inject-plan.sh` so the session is never dark without a stated cause.

### Fixed
- **`plan-doctor.sh` reported PASS on a fully dark-hooks state (closes #236, reported by @sortakool).** The injection check substring-matched five control strings against output that carries the plan body verbatim inside the `===BEGIN-PWF-DATA===` fences, which produced two defects. A plan whose phase line read "fix the false PLAN TAMPERED warning in plan-doctor" reported a hash mismatch while correctly attested, and no documentation reserved those phrases. Worse, the `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` arm matched `PWF_PLAN_ROOT is not a directory`, which is not a substring of the text `inject-plan.sh` emits, so the arm was dead code and execution fell through to the success arm: `PWF_PLAN_ROOT=/nonexistent` printed `PASS injection: emits plan context (123 bytes)` while nothing was injected at all, counting the refusal notice's own bytes as plan context. The file's own comment four lines above already warned that reporting a refusal's byte count as PASS tells a dark user their hooks are fine. Classification now branches on the frame: every refusal path exits before `frame_file` runs, so a frame proves injection happened, and unframed output is by construction a notice. The default arm warns, so a future reworded or translated banner degrades noisily instead of silently. The stale literal is corrected against the emitting `echo`.
- **`attest-plan.sh` reported "No task_plan.md found" when a selector was refused.** True but misleading: the plan exists and the selector was the problem. It now names the selector that refused.

### Changed
- v3.14.0 made the Hermes and OpenCode resolvers fall through on an unresolvable `PLAN_ID`, to match `resolve-plan-dir.sh`. That parity was correct and the target was wrong. All three plugin resolvers now bind instead, along with the shell.
- The Hermes and OpenCode plugins apply the root `.mode` floor as well, so `mode_tokens` and `modeTokens` take the project root alongside the plan directory. A malformed root `.mode` on the OpenCode side returns the same "not allowed" signal a malformed slug `.mode` already produced, which fails the plan closed rather than treating an unreadable policy as no policy.
- Version bumped to 3.15.0 across the tracked parity set and the ClawHub stage. The OpenCode plugin package goes to 1.0.1 and the Pi extension to 1.2.5, since both changed.

### Verification
- Python suite 653 to 696 tests, plus 28 to 34 in the OpenCode Vitest suite. New files `test_plan_selector_binding.py`, `test_root_mode_floor.py` and `test_plan_doctor_classification.py`; new arms in `test_resolver_parity.py`, `test_resolve_plan_dir.py`, `test_resolver_plan_root_pin.py`, `test_hermes_first_class.py` and the OpenCode suite. Five existing tests asserted the fall-through and were rewritten to assert the refusal, keeping their original security assertion intact.
- Each suite carries its own control arm, because two of the first drafts passed on fixtures that could not have failed: a completion-gate assertion over a plan with every phase complete, where the gate resolves to advisory whether or not it is armed, and a parallel-write-guard assertion over a plan with nothing checked to lose.
- The `plan-doctor` suite drives the real `inject-plan.sh` rather than a synthetic string, since literal drift is the actual defect, and adds a stub that emits an unknown banner to pin the drift property itself.
- All three issues were reproduced on Windows with Git Bash before the fix and re-run after, including @sortakool's control arms.

### Thanks
- Raymond, for three issues filed separately so each could be fixed and verified on its own, each with a control arm, a traced mechanism, and in #236 both a suggested patch and the more robust alternative that was taken instead (#236, #237, #238).

## [3.14.0] - 2026-09-02

OpenCode becomes a first-class host through its own plugin system, and issue #235 is fixed. Verified against OpenCode 1.18.21: the plugin loaded from a project config directory, `pwf_init`, `pwf_status` and `pwf_check` appeared in the tool list, `/pwf` and `/pwf-status` in the command list, and a real session message received the framed plan as a synthetic part.

### Added
- **Native OpenCode plugin `opencode-planning-with-files`** (`.opencode/packages/opencode-planning-with-files/`, npm package, TypeScript). Hooks: `chat.message` appends the framed active plan to every user message (plan head, normalized progress tail, findings pointer) or a once-per-turn ambiguity notice; `tool.execute.after` appends the progress reminder to `write`, `edit`, `patch`, `multiedit` and `apply_patch` output; `experimental.session.compacting` keeps the plan pointer and attestation hash in the compaction context; `event` on `session.idle` runs the completion gate in gated mode and re-prompts the session with the gate reason through the SDK. Tools `pwf_init` (root or `.planning/<date>-<slug>/`, `mode: autonomous` or `gated` with the v3 markers and attestation), `pwf_status`, `pwf_check`. Each session is resolved from its own OpenCode directory; child sessions are never re-prompted.
- **Plan resolution and gate parity in TypeScript.** Same precedence as `resolve-plan-dir.sh` (`PLAN_ID`, BOM-tolerant `.active_plan`, newest slug, legacy root) with slug validation, lstat-based symlink refusal and containment; the `inject-plan.sh` nested-root rule (only a live nested plan competes; a `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` pin or `PLAN_ID` skips it; `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` fails closed); the `check-complete.sh --gate` decision table with per-field maximum status counting and the shared `.stop_blocks` and `.gate_last_ledger` files; `init-session.sh` markers; the same framed injection format with a content-derived nonce, byte bound, SHA-256 and `DATA ONLY` preamble; attestation refusal for tampered or unattested v3 plans.
- **Commands** `.opencode/commands/pwf.md` and `pwf-status.md` in OpenCode's own Markdown command format, and a dogfood entry `.opencode/plugins/planning-with-files.ts` that loads the plugin from source when this repository is opened in OpenCode (`.opencode/package.json` now tracked with the `@opencode-ai/plugin` dependency).
- **Vitest suite** (22 tests: resolver, BOM, ambiguity, pin, framing, tampering, gate counters and stall, mixed status formats, init markers, status, plugin hooks against a fake client, tools) and a `vitest (OpenCode plugin)` CI job that typechecks, builds and tests the package.

### Fixed
- **`docs/opencode.md` named the wrong install location (closes #235, reported by @luyanfeng).** `npx skills add OthmanAdi/planning-with-files --skill planning-with-files -g` installs to `~/.agents/skills/planning-with-files/`, not `~/.config/opencode/skills/`. OpenCode reads `~/.agents/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.config/opencode/skills/` and the project-local `.agents/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.opencode/skills/`, so the install works; the page, the `.opencode` skill's restore-context snippets and its file-location table now name the real paths and probe every location.
- **OpenCode was listed as an Enhanced host on the strength of `hooks:` frontmatter OpenCode never runs.** The tier tables, `MIGRATION.md` and the README now say what each install actually gets: skill-only installs stay notify-only, the native plugin is Tier 2 (follow-up inject).

### Changed
- README: OpenCode install block and matrix row, command table, hooks reference row, and the host tier bullets name the native plugin; `docs/installation.md` gains the OpenCode route.
- Version bumped to 3.14.0 across the tracked parity set and the ClawHub stage. The OpenCode plugin package carries its own version (1.0.0), like the Pi extension.

### Fixed (Hermes)
- **A `PLAN_ID` that did not resolve blacked out injection on Hermes.** The Python resolver returned nothing for a stale slug; `resolve-plan-dir.sh` falls through to the pointer, the newest slug and the legacy root. Both the Hermes plugin and the OpenCode plugin now fall through.

### Verification
- 25 Vitest tests for the OpenCode plugin plus the Python suite; live load in OpenCode 1.18.21.
- An independent adversarial review by a second model before release found three confirmed divergences in the first build (a failed session lookup was cached and pinned the session to the server directory, the tools bypassed `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` and `PLANNING_DISABLED`, a stale `PLAN_ID` did not fall through) plus a missing idempotency guard, an untested link-escape path, a rootless Windows pin, ledger counting that differed from `grep -c ''`, and a non-unique attestation temp file. All fixed with tests.

### Thanks
- Luyanfeng reported the install path mismatch in issue #235, the second OpenCode docs bug they caught.

## [3.13.0] - 2026-09-01

Hermes Agent by Nous Research becomes a first-class host, on the CLI and in Hermes Desktop. Every claim in this entry was checked against the Hermes v0.19.1 source and a live install: the plugin was loaded through Hermes' own plugin manager, and the skill bundle was scanned with Hermes' `skills-guard`.

### Added
- **Hermes plugin 0.2.0: slug-mode plans, the completion gate, real slash commands, a bundled skill.** The native plugin (`.hermes/plugins/planning-with-files/`) now resolves the active plan the way every other host does: `PLAN_ID`, then `.planning/.active_plan`, then the newest `.planning/<slug>/task_plan.md`, then the legacy root file, with the same slug validation and containment rules as `resolve-plan-dir.sh` (including a BOM-tolerant `.active_plan`) and the same nested-root ambiguity rule as `inject-plan.sh`: only a live nested plan (`<child>/.planning/<slug>/task_plan.md`) competes, a `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` pin, an attached session or an explicit `PLAN_ID` skips the check, legacy root plans are guarded too, and the refusal is announced once per turn. Slug plans read their attestation from `<slug>/.attestation` and their mode from `<slug>/.mode`; the injection names the resolved plan. `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` pins the project root and fails closed, and `PLANNING_DISABLED=1` silences every hook. Before this release the adapter only ever saw a root `task_plan.md`, so any plan created with `init-session.sh <name>` was invisible on Hermes.
- **Completion gate on Hermes.** The plugin registers `pre_verify`, Hermes' verification-loop hook, and answers it with a continuation request while an `in_progress` phase remains in a gated plan. The decision table is the one `check-complete.sh --gate` applies (gate token, in_progress phase, block cap `PWF_GATE_CAP`, ledger stall, per-field maximum of `**Status:**` and inline `[in_progress]` markers so mixed-format plans cannot slip past), implemented in Python so Hermes Desktop on Windows needs no `sh`; both routes share `.stop_blocks` and `.gate_last_ledger`. Hermes fires the hook only on turns that changed files and caps continuations at `agent.max_verify_nudges` (default 3), so Hermes sits in Tier 2 (follow-up inject) next to Cursor, Pi and Kiro.
- **`/pwf`, `/pwf-status`, `/plan-status`** registered through `ctx.register_command`, so they work in `hermes chat`, gateway sessions and Desktop. `/pwf --gated Night run` creates `.planning/YYYY-MM-DD-night-run/`, writes `.mode`, `.nonce`, resets the gate counter and attests the plan, mirroring `init-session.sh --gated`. `planning_with_files_init` gained `name` and `mode` parameters for the same operations from the model. `/plan` is Hermes' own bundled skill and is deliberately not shadowed.
- **Bundled skill registration** through `ctx.register_skill`, so `skill_view("planning-with-files:planning-with-files")` works even when the hub install was skipped, and a Python completion check that reports `"route": "python"` when `sh` is absent.
- **Shell-hook bridge** (`shell_hook.py` in the plugin directory) for users who prefer Hermes' config-file hooks: it runs the canonical `inject-plan.sh` and `gate-stop.sh` and translates their output to the Hermes wire shapes. Documented as a CLI-only advanced route.
- **`tests/test_hermes_first_class.py`**, 18 tests: resolver precedence, invalid slugs, `PWF_PLAN_ROOT`, the ambiguity rule, `PLANNING_DISABLED`, slug attestation, the gate (block, counter, stall, cap), legacy and autonomous plans never held, `init_plan` markers, the Python completion fallback, registration against a full and a reduced `PluginContext`, the slash commands, the manifest, and the shell-hook bridge end to end.
- **README sections**: "Built for long-running agent tasks", "Hermes Agent: first-class support (CLI and Desktop)" and "Multi-agent runs: orchestrators, workers and subagents", each grounded in mechanisms that already ship.

### Fixed
- **The `.hermes` SKILL.md pointed Windows users at `~\.hermes`.** Native Windows Hermes keeps its home under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes` (`hermes_constants._get_platform_default_hermes_home`); both restore-context blocks now fall back to that path.
- **`.hermes/commands/plan.md` and `plan-status.md` were never loaded.** Hermes has no Markdown command loader; the two commands documented since v2.35.0 did nothing. The plugin registers them now, and the Markdown files stay as documentation of the intent.
- **`docs/hermes.md` claimed Hermes had no stop-hook equivalent.** Current Hermes exposes `pre_verify`; the page now documents the gate, its limits, the Desktop route, the Windows paths and the `hermes import-agent claude-code` migration, and states that the canonical `skills/planning-with-files` path is refused by Hermes' `skills-guard` scanner (hook frontmatter, command substitution, deep relative links, `os.environ` in the canonical catchup script) while the `.hermes` bundle scans `SAFE`. The bundle is the supported install path: `hermes skills install OthmanAdi/planning-with-files/.hermes/skills/planning-with-files` and `hermes plugins install OthmanAdi/planning-with-files/.hermes/plugins/planning-with-files`.

### Changed
- README reorganized for readability: install routes, the collapsible platform and FAQ sections, and the new feature sections come first; benchmarks, the repository layout, releases, community and documentation form the reference half at the bottom. No content was removed; the "At a glance" test count now reflects the current suite.
- Host capability tier tables in the English SKILL.md copies (canonical, `.agents`, `.pi`, ClawHub stage) and `MIGRATION.md` list Hermes Agent under Tier 2. The translated variants keep their own tables.
- The Hermes SKILL.md frontmatter carries `metadata.hermes.tags` for hub categorization; the description is unchanged.
- Version bumped to 3.13.0 across the tracked parity set plus the ClawHub stage. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi` SKILL.md and `.kiro` lag intentionally.

### Verification
- 60 existing Hermes-related tests plus the new ones pass; the full suite is green on this machine.
- An independent adversarial review by a second model before release found four divergences from the shell route in the first build (an over-broad and silent nested-root rule, a pin that did not clear ambiguity, an unguarded legacy root, and mixed-format plans slipping the gate) plus a BOM in `.active_plan` selecting the wrong plan. All were fixed and are covered by tests, including a differential test that runs `inject-plan.sh` and the Python resolver over the same fixtures.
- Live load in the Hermes 0.19.1 plugin manager (scratch `HERMES_HOME`): three hooks, three commands and the bundled skill registered; `planning_with_files_init` produced an attested gated slug plan; `pre_llm_call` injected it with its plan id; `pre_verify` returned the continuation through `get_pre_verify_continue_message`; a stale attestation was refused with `context blocked: PLAN TAMPERED`; the write reminder arrived on the next turn.
- `hermes skills inspect` and `hermes skills install` of the `.hermes` bundle succeed from the hub with a `SAFE` verdict; the canonical path is blocked with a dangerous verdict, which is why the docs name the bundle path.

## [3.12.1] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- **Running an attestation helper from inside `.planning/<slug>/` wrote a legacy `.plan-attestation` file and left the slug's real `.attestation` stale (fixes #234, reported by @sortakool).** The shell and PowerShell helpers now recognize a valid direct slug directory, update its `.attestation`, and preserve the same target for show and clear operations. An explicit `PLAN_ID` or `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` that does not resolve now stops without attesting another local plan through the current-directory fallback.
- **Cross-platform hook and resolver checks failed on macOS and Windows.** The Codex and Hermes context readers now admit only verified macOS system aliases (`/var`, `/tmp`, and `/etc`) to their fixed `/private/...` targets, while other links remain rejected. The PowerShell attester now refuses to run on Unix where its safe no-follow operation is unavailable, and malformed or dangling `.planning/.active_plan` entries stop resolution instead of selecting a legacy plan. When native canonicalization tools are unavailable, the shell resolver now uses only an explicitly trusted absolute Python path instead of selecting Python or Perl from `PATH`. The injector's containment fallback now accepts only an explicitly supplied, validated interpreter and defers PATH discovery until containment succeeds, so a BSD environment that supplies only `PWF_TRUSTED_PYTHON` does not silently suppress plan context.

### Verification
- The v3.12.0 failure was reproduced from both invocation locations: the first call from the project root created the slug attestation, while the second call from inside the slug directory exited successfully, created the legacy file, and left the real attestation stale.
- The clean issue regression and mirror-sync suite passed with 24 tests, 5 platform skips, and 13 subtests. Focused resolver, containment, hook integration, command contract, and line-ending suites passed with 74 tests and 6 platform skips.
- All 15 maintained shell copies passed syntax checks, and the 15 shell copies and 15 PowerShell copies are byte-identical within their respective sets.
- The exact detached v3.12.1 candidate passed the complete Python 3.12 suite with 598 tests, 29 platform skips, and 785 subtests.
- After the first remote matrix exposed a BSD-harness injection mismatch, the corrected full flow passed all 3 BSD-userland tests in a Linux container with Python absent from `PATH`.
- The final post-correction Python 3.12 candidate passed the complete suite with 598 tests, 31 platform skips, and 785 subtests in 2732.99 seconds.

### Thanks
- Raymond Manaloto (@sortakool) supplied a minimal reproduction, identified the split between the resolver and attestation path, and explained why the next root invocation reports a false tamper event in issue #234.

## [3.12.0] - 2026-08-30

### Security
- **Automatic catchup no longer reads host transcript or session stores.** SessionStart and other automatic callers now pass `--no-history` explicitly. A user must select `--metadata` to obtain same-project aggregate counts or `--replay` to obtain bounded same-project excerpts. Metadata output excludes transcript text, tool commands, errors, raw paths, and raw session identifiers. Replay remains nonce-framed as untrusted data and quarantines records that cannot be bound to the current project.
- **Phase status updates no longer proceed after lock acquisition fails.** Shell and PowerShell writers use the same stable directory lock, retry for a bounded interval, perform phase checks while holding the lock, and return nonzero without reading or writing status when the lock remains unavailable. Lock cleanup is limited to the owner that created it.
- Project context resolution preserves direct-hook compatibility while refusing cross-project recovery data and ambiguous project identity. These protections now apply across the Claude, Codex, Copilot, Gemini, Pi, Agent Skills, custom-adapter, and translated catchup paths.
- Install-facing planning templates contain no hidden HTML instructions. Operational guidance is visible, and Markdown content is treated as user-controlled project data rather than executable authority.

### Added
- First-class Claude and Codex plugin lifecycle surfaces, including cache-safe hook activation and complete Codex plugin operations.
- `scripts/build-clawhub-upload.py` rebuilds the complete gitignored ClawHub stage from the tracked canonical inventory and verifies exact file, byte, line-ending, and containment parity before manual upload.

### Fixed
- The Codex plugin manifest is now part of the release version parity set, bringing the maintained set to 19 tracked targets plus the optional local ClawHub stage.
- **Direct `-h` and `--help` queries created and activated plans (PR #233 by @lowmiaq-gmail, fixes #232).** `init-session.sh` had no help branch, so both flags fell through to `PROJECT_NAME`, enabled slug mode, created three planning files, and replaced `.planning/.active_plan`. Both direct flags now print usage and return successfully before any filesystem initialization.
- **The npm release path could pack CRLF shell scripts from a stale Windows working tree (fixes #231, reported by @mfehlhaber).** Source attributes and repository tests protected Git bytes but did not inspect the tarball that npm actually publishes. The package now runs a dependency-free `prepack` verifier that fails on any carriage-return byte instead of rewriting files, and a regression builds the real archive and checks the complete shell-script inventory. The current npm `3.11.2` artifact is LF-clean; the new gate prevents the `3.10.2` failure from recurring.

### Changed
- Capability descriptions now disclose selected project-context injection, explicit same-project local-record modes, optional completion gating where the host supports it, and the absence of a network upload path. Adapter-specific descriptions do not claim capabilities their host does not provide.
- Planning templates use visible guidance and describe the executable gate accurately. The gate reads mode, phase state, stop state, and ledger progress; it does not execute commands or treat `AcceptanceCheck`, `DependsOn`, ownership, or model-routing fields as runtime authority.
- The bundled Pi extension moves to 1.2.4, the Kiro adapter moves to 3.0.1-kiro, and the Hermes plugin moves to 0.1.1 for their changed runtime or distribution surfaces.
- `docs/quickstart.md` now shows how to inspect the initialization options without creating files or changing the active plan.
- The npm archive includes the verifier referenced by its own `prepack` lifecycle, so repacking an installed package retains the same fail-closed check.

### Verification
- Full Python suite: 592 passed, 24 skipped, and 766 subtests passed.
- Security and distribution integration suite: 210 passed, 4 skipped, and 656 subtests passed.
- Pi extension 1.2.4: 48 Vitest tests passed across 3 files.
- Version parity, frontmatter, and ClawHub builder suite: 24 tests passed. The complete ClawHub stage contains 29 canonical files with no hidden HTML instructions, stale scanner phrases, cache artifacts, or carriage-return bytes in shipped scripts.
- `sync-ide-folders.py --verify`, `build-clawhub-upload.py --verify`, `bump-version.py 3.12.0 --dry-run`, the npm package dry run, and repository diff checks passed.

### Thanks
- @lowmiaq-gmail supplied the minimal state-mutation reproduction, the direct POSIX-shell fix, and regression coverage for both help flags in PR #233.
- @mfehlhaber separated clean repository source from the broken npm artifact, identified the exact six CRLF scripts, and traced Pi's generic attestation failure back to the swallowed shell error in issue #231.

## [3.11.2] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed
- **The two manual skills-only install commands copied the whole `skills/` directory after the language variants moved under `skills/i18n/` (PR #229 by @dylanpulver).** The Unix and PowerShell instructions now copy only `skills/planning-with-files`, so an English install no longer creates an unusable `~/.claude/skills/i18n/` entry or places the five translations one directory below the paths their commands probe.
- **A fresh manual install could flatten the canonical skill into `~/.claude/skills/`.** With one source directory and no existing destination, `cp` and `Copy-Item` can create the destination from the source contents, leaving `SKILL.md` directly under `skills/`. Both instructions now create `~/.claude/skills` before copying the canonical skill directory into it.

### Changed
- `tests/test_plugin_skill_surface.py` now scans tracked Markdown for `cp` or `Copy-Item` commands that copy `skills/*` wholesale. It also locks the destination-creation step before both manual copies and falls back to a filesystem scan when Git is unavailable.

### Verification
- Required baseline before integration: 434 passed, 10 skipped, and 497 subtests passed.
- Exact contributor head before the maintainer hardening: 435 passed, 10 skipped, and 497 subtests passed.
- Amended release candidate: 436 passed, 10 skipped, and 499 subtests passed. GitHub Actions passed on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows, and the Pi extension Vitest job passed.
- `sync-ide-folders.py --verify` reports every maintained mirror in sync. `bump-version.py 3.11.2 --dry-run` resolves all 19 present parity targets with zero errors.

### Thanks
- Dylan traced the regression to the v3.11.0 language-directory move, found the only two whole-directory copy commands in tracked documentation, and added the guard that keeps that install shape out of future docs (PR #229).

## [3.11.1] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed
- **The Copilot error hook could not be parsed by a POSIX shell (PR #228 by @dylanpulver).** `error-occurred.sh` fed both of its Python helpers with `<<<`, a bash here-string that dash does not implement. `tests/test_planning_disabled_optout.py` invokes the shell hooks as `["sh", script]`, so the `#!/bin/bash` shebang never applied, and on ubuntu runners, where `/bin/sh` is dash, the file died at line 32 with `Syntax error: redirection unexpected`. Master CI had failed on the ubuntu leg for five consecutive runs. Both call sites now pipe with `printf '%s\n'`. The four sibling hooks pipe with `echo`, and that form was deliberately not copied: dash's builtin `echo` expands backslash escapes, so an escaped newline inside an error message would come back as a real control character and `json.load` would reject it, trading a loud parse failure for a silent one. No user was affected, because `.github/hooks/planning-with-files.json` invokes the hook under a `bash` key, which bypasses both the shebang and the exec bit. This is a CI and portability fix.
- The v3.11.0 changelog entry warning that shell hooks must not emit JSON with `echo` contained two raw newlines of its own, inside the code spans for `\n` and `printf '%s\n'`. The escapes were expanded when the entry was written, which broke both spans across lines.

### Verification
- The failure was reproduced locally against real dash rather than taken from the report: the pre-fix hook exits 2 with `Syntax error: redirection unexpected` at line 32, matching the ubuntu log verbatim, and the post-fix hook exits 0 and emits valid JSON with the newline escaped as two characters.
- All five scripts in `.github/hooks/scripts/` were parsed under a POSIX shell. Before the change `error-occurred.sh` was the only one that failed, and after it none do.
- The reasoning for avoiding `echo` was checked directly. Under dash, `echo` on the raw payload produces a literal newline and `json.load` rejects it with `Invalid control character`, while `printf '%s\n'` round trips.
- Full Python suite on Windows: 434 passed, 10 skipped, 497 subtests passed.

### Known limitations
- The four `.gemini/hooks/*.sh` still carry `<<<`. Nothing runs them through `sh`, and `.gemini/settings.json` invokes them by path so their shebang applies, so they are out of scope here. `.gemini` is on the intentionally lagging list and moving it needs its own scope decision.

### Thanks
- Dylan found this in CI rather than in a bug report, reproduced the ubuntu condition locally instead of guessing at it, and confirmed the suite actually exercises the path by reverting his own change. He also declined the obvious fix: copying the `echo` form used by the four sibling hooks would have made the syntax error disappear while introducing a silent JSON corruption, and he said so in the pull request instead of leaving it to review. The scope note on `.gemini` is accurate on every point (PR #228).

## [3.11.0] - 2026-08-20

### Changed
- **The plugin registers one skill instead of six (closes #130, reported by @sean3808; implemented by @dylanpulver in PR #226).** The five language variants moved from `skills/planning-with-files-<lang>/` to `skills/i18n/planning-with-files-<lang>/`. Nothing was deleted, renamed or merged. All five skill names, all five `npx skills add --skill` commands, and all five install destinations are exactly what they were. One directory of depth is the whole mechanism: Claude Code discovers a plugin's skills by scanning `skills/*/SKILL.md` at a single level without recursing, so a variant one level down is not registered on the plugin route, while `npx skills add` resolves `--skill` by skill name across a recursive scan and does not care about depth.
- **The five language commands read their translated skill from disk.** `/plan-ar`, `/plan-de`, `/plan-es`, `/plan-zh` and `/plan-zht` now read `$HOME/.claude/skills/planning-with-files-<lang>/SKILL.md` first, then `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/i18n/planning-with-files-<lang>/SKILL.md`, and fall back to the canonical skill with an explicit instruction to keep working in that language. Each one also states that the status tokens stay literal English, because `check-complete.sh` matches them with `grep -F` and a translated token silently disables the completion gate.

### Fixed
- The second candidate path in the five language commands pointed at the marketplace clone rather than the running plugin. That clone tracks the default branch while an installed plugin is version-pinned, and it does not exist at all under `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or the zip-cache route. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is substituted by the loader and is what the repository already uses in command prose.
- `README.md` still advertised the five variant skill ids as model-invocable, which stops being true once the plugin no longer registers them.
- **Seven shell hooks could emit JSON with a raw control character on macOS (reported by @dylanpulver).** They build their payload by interpolating a `json.dumps` result and emitting it with `echo`. Under their own `#!/bin/bash` shebang that is correct, but run with `sh` on macOS, where `/bin/sh` is bash in POSIX mode with `xpg_echo` set, `echo` turns the escaped `\n` inside the string back into a real newline and every parser rejects the result. All seven now use `printf '%s\n'`, which never interprets backslashes. Found while rebasing #226, with the one-line repro supplied.

### Added
- **`docs/languages.md`.** The five translations had no documentation page of their own: `docs/` carried a setup guide for every supported IDE and nothing for languages, and `docs/installation.md` did not mention them at all. Six lines in the README were the entire discovery path, which mattered less while the plugin auto-registered the variants and is now the only way in. The new page covers the table of names and commands, the install command per language, the repository layout, how the language commands behave on the plugin route, and why the status tokens stay literal English. Linked from the README and from `docs/installation.md`.

### Verification
- Measured against the real Claude Code loader rather than inferred. Debug output on the merged tree: `Loaded 1 skills from plugin ... default directory`, down from 6. Component inventory 19 to 14, projected always-on cost roughly 2,254 to 1,042 tokens per session. All thirteen slash commands survive, including the five language ones.
- The skills CLI still discovers all seven skills in the moved layout by name. `npx skills add . --skill planning-with-files-de` in an isolated home installs to the same destination as before, with the translated SKILL.md and the full 20-script surface, and pulls in nothing else.
- The German template writes literal `**Status:** in_progress` and the German `check-complete.sh` matches that exact string, so the completion gate is intact for non-English users.
- Full Python suite: 434 passed, 10 skipped, 497 subtests passed. `sync-ide-folders.py --verify` clean. `bump-version.py` resolves the parity set at the new paths.
- All 120 moved files are pure renames. No translated content was altered.

### Known limitations
- An existing variant install records the old path in its skills lock file, so `npx skills update` cannot resolve it until the skill is reinstalled. The installed skill keeps working and a fresh install always works. No change to this PR can avoid it; it is inherent to moving a directory.

### Thanks

This one took four attempts across seven months of the issue tracker to answer, so credit goes to everyone who pushed on it.

- Sean opened #130 in April with the analysis that framed the whole problem: the scripts and templates were identical, only the prose differed, and the six skills were costing every session five descriptions it did not need. Every later attempt is a variation on that report.
- Dylan wrote the answer that shipped (#226). He found the one-level plugin scan, checked the install route rather than assuming it, and carried the literal English status-token warning into all five commands where a previous attempt had not. He also named the one cost he could not remove, which is what made the change reviewable.
- Som audited the five variants against the canonical skill in #216 and proved the drift #130 predicted: twelve missing scripts, a missing Windows UTF-8 fix, and sync tooling that covered only three dispatch targets. That analysis shipped as v3.10.0 and had to land before this change was safe.
- Abdullah asked in #151 for a single canonical source with a CI parity gate. The gate shipped in v2.37.0 and is the reason this move could be verified rather than hoped at.
- The earliest two reports were about the same duplication from the other direction: #53 by @back1ply proposed collapsing the eight client folders into one source, and #47 by @tiptinker asked for the Anthropic skills layout. Both are why `sync-ide-folders.py` exists.

**On why this took so long.** The obvious fix was to delete the five directories, and it was proposed more than once. It could not be taken. Skill listings on a public directory cannot be retracted once published, so deleting the folders would not have removed the entries; it would have left five permanent listings whose install command had started to fail, which is worse for the people using them than either keeping or removing them. The variants also have real users who chose them deliberately, and a breaking change to a working install is not a reasonable price for a packaging problem. What was needed was a route that changes nothing anyone depends on, and it took until #226 to find one. The delay was not indecision about whether the problem was real. It was refusing to fix it by breaking installs.

## [3.10.2] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed
- **`PLANNING_DISABLED=1` did nothing on the GitHub Copilot route (PR #223, by @Whxuan0701).** The per-invocation opt-out from #195 reached the canonical, `.agents` and Codex routes in v3.9.0, but all ten Copilot entry points under `.github/hooks/scripts/` still read `task_plan.md` and emitted planning context whatever the variable said. That is the failure #195 was filed about: a one-shot task that merely shares a working directory with an unrelated plan gets that plan attached on every session start, matched tool call, error and stop, with no way to turn it off. All five shell and five PowerShell hooks now exit before touching the plan file.
- **The same opt-out was inoperative on all eight Cursor hooks.** The Cursor route reads `task_plan.md` directly rather than dispatching to `scripts/inject-plan.sh`, which is where the #195 guard lives, so `PLANNING_DISABLED=1` never reached `pre-tool-use`, `post-tool-use`, `stop` or `user-prompt-submit` in either shell or PowerShell. Each guard reproduces its own hook's no-plan-file output, so the Cursor protocol shape is unchanged: `PreToolUse` still answers `{"decision": "allow"}` because that is what it emits unconditionally today, and the other three stay silent. `.gemini` is deliberately behind and is not covered.
- **Disabling the skill made Copilot's `PreToolUse` more permissive than leaving it on.** The merged guard answered `permissionDecision: allow` on the disabled path, so a user who set the variable to make planning inert also handed every tool call a blanket approval it would not otherwise have had. Both the shell and PowerShell hooks now emit `{}`, matching their own no-plan-file path, which returns the decision to Copilot.
- **The Copilot PowerShell stop hook reported "Task incomplete (0/0 phases done)" for a plan with no phase headings (PR #222, by @Whxuan0701).** The #191 guard shipped to `agent-stop.sh` and to the canonical scripts and never reached `agent-stop.ps1`, so Windows Copilot users kept getting the false nag the fix was written to remove.
- **`.cursor/hooks/stop.ps1` was the last copy the #191 fix never reached.** It answered `0/0 phases done` and auto-continued on a plan that was never phase-structured. A repository-wide sweep of every script that emits a `(N/M phases done)` message now finds no unguarded copy left.
- **The Copilot PowerShell error hook had never logged an error on Windows.** `error-occurred.ps1` read stdin into `$input`, which is PowerShell's automatic pipeline variable: under `-File` the assignment does not stick, so the JSON parse always saw an empty string and the hook emitted `{}` every time. Reproduced under both pwsh 7 and Windows PowerShell 5.1 before the rename.
- **The Hermes determinism probe could not run on a host without a `python` alias (PR #224, by @Whxuan0701).** `tests/test_injection_determinism.py` spawned a hardcoded `python`, which does not exist on a default macOS setup or on any host that ships only `python3`, so the probe raised `FileNotFoundError` instead of testing anything. It now reuses `sys.executable`.

### Changed
- The opt-out tests run every hook twice, once with the variable unset and once with it set, and fail if the unset run is already inert. The merged versions asserted only the disabled run, which a fleet of hooks that emit `{}` unconditionally would also have passed: gutting all ten Copilot hooks left the suite green. That is the silent-death class behind the v3.6.0 realpath failure and the v3.8.0 Stop hook, and it is now the one thing these tests cannot miss. The `error-occurred.ps1` `$input` bug is what the new baseline caught first.

### Verification
- Full Python suite: 430 passed, 11 skipped, 492 subtests passed. Baseline before the three merges was 424 passed, 11 skipped, 474 subtests.
- Each fix was mutation-tested rather than assumed: stripping all ten Copilot guards fails 9 assertions, gutting the hook fleet to unconditional `{}` fails 6, restoring `$input` in the error hook fails the anti-vacuity baseline by name, and stripping the eight Cursor guards plus the `stop.ps1` phase guard fails 9.
- `#222` and `#223` both edit `agent-stop.ps1`. The combined tree was tested after both landed, not only in isolation.
- All four `.ps1` files that carry non-ASCII keep their UTF-8 BOM, every touched script is pure LF, and `sh -n` parses all nine shell hooks.
- `scripts/sync-ide-folders.py --verify` clean; `scripts/bump-version.py 3.10.2` reports 19 changed, 0 errors.

### Thanks
- Haoxuan sent three single-commit PRs rather than one bundle: the Copilot opt-out gap (#223), the missing zero-phase guard on the Copilot PowerShell stop hook (#222), and the hardcoded interpreter in the Hermes probe (#224). Each arrived with a test that executes the real script. Auditing them is what surfaced the Cursor route, the `PreToolUse` permission widening and the `$input` bug.

## [3.10.1] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- **Codex on Linux and macOS rejected active planning context from `SessionStart` and `UserPromptSubmit` as invalid JSON (fixes #220, reported by @mfehlhaber).** The POSIX hook commands called shell producers whose output begins `[planning-with-files]`; Codex treats output beginning with `[` as JSON and rejected it. All three shell-backed context events now route through `run_sh.py`, which emits event-appropriate JSON for `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, and `PreCompact`.
- **The tracked npm package source and the published tarball had different provenance.** `planning-with-files@3.10.0` already contained all 20 shared scripts, but its recorded `gitHead` preceded the commit that added eight of those files to the repository. The tracked npm payload and sync manifest now match the published surface, so the next tag, source tree, and package are aligned.
- **The release reference listed the wrong version-parity files.** `AGENTS.md` included the independently versioned Kiro and Pi skill files and omitted the npm package manifest. It now matches `scripts/bump-version.py` and the parity test.
- **The version bumper failed in fresh clones that correctly lacked the gitignored ClawHub upload stage.** The parity test had treated this manual staging file as optional since v3.0.0, but `scripts/bump-version.py` still reported it as a fatal missing target. The bumper now reports an absent stage explicitly without failing, while continuing to update and validate it whenever it exists.

### Changed
- The installation docs now distinguish direct npm vendoring from Pi's automatically wired route. The npm listing describes `planning-with-files` as the cross-agent package while retaining its bundled Pi extension.
- The README's `/clear` comparison now uses committed terminal-style SVG illustrations, the statistics table has an explicit "At a glance" heading, and the repository layout no longer hard-codes a stale test count.
- The Codex guide now documents the shared POSIX and Windows hook adapter, the `python3` requirement on macOS and Linux, and the need to review changed hook definitions with `/hooks` after upgrading.

### Verification
- Full Python suite: 424 passed, 11 skipped, and 474 subtests passed.
- Focused Codex hook suite: 19 passed, including routing, event JSON, no-context silence, and `PLANNING_DISABLED=1` silence for all three shell-backed events.
- Version-bumper regression and version-parity tests: 9 passed.
- Version, frontmatter, hook-dispatch, and mirror parity gate: 40 passed, 10 skipped, and 131 subtests passed.
- Pi extension: 48 Vitest tests passed. The npm dry-run tarball contains the expected 40 files and all 20 shared scripts.
- ClawHub staging bundle: all 29 canonical files match by SHA-256, with no cache or credential artifacts.

### Thanks
- @mfehlhaber reported that the Codex POSIX `SessionStart` and `UserPromptSubmit` routes bypassed the event JSON adapter (#220).

## [3.10.0] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- **Two sessions sharing one plan directory could silently destroy each other's work (closes #217, reported by @dubes394).** Both agents read `task_plan.md`, both write it back, and the later write discards the earlier one's phases. Nothing noticed: injection emitted the clobbered file as an ordinary edit, `plan-doctor` reported PASS, and the Stop gate read the reverted status as current. Attestation was the nearest mechanism and did not cover it: it is opt-in in legacy mode, it compares against a baseline a human approved once rather than against what the hooks last observed, it reports a collaborator's edit with the same `[PLAN TAMPERED]` wording as a hostile rewrite, and it is a read-side gate that cannot stop the stale write from landing. The new guard compares progress between turn-start fires instead of hashes, because a hash comparison would flag a single agent's own edit on its very next fire. Checked items and completed phases only go up during normal work, so a decrease means work that was on disk is gone, and forward motion stays silent (tests/test_plan_regression_guard.py).
- **Every non-English install was a subset install (#130).** The five language variants shipped 8 of the 20 scripts the canonical skill ships. `attest-plan`, `gate-stop`, `ledger-append`, `ledger-summary.ps1`, `phase-status`, `plan-doctor`, `resolve-plan-dir.ps1` and `set-active-plan` had never reached them, so attestation, the completion gate, the ledger, phase status and plan-doctor were absent for the 39.8K installs those five listings carry. `sync-ide-folders.py` covered only the three hook dispatch targets from #212, so the gap was structural and every future feature would have kept missing them. Closed additively: 60 files created, 0 overwritten.
- **A non-ASCII session log still crashed session recovery on a Windows legacy code page in all five language variants.** `configure_utf8_stdio()` shipped in v3.2.0 but only to the canonical skill, leaving the failure live for exactly the users most likely to have non-ASCII content. Backported by insertion so the translated prose in those files is untouched.
- **The top of the README was unreadable on a phone.** The before/after comparison used `width="50%"` cells, which GitHub honors directly, so the two columns locked to a 50/50 split of a roughly 340px container instead of scrolling as one unit, crushing the `<pre>` block that shows the actual injection payload into a strip with a nested scrollbar. The stats panel was a 48-column box-drawing block needing about 375px, with every value right-flushed, so a first-time mobile visitor saw five labels and no numbers. Both restructured, all content preserved.

### Added
- `PWF_PLAN_GUARD=0`, and a `plan-guard-off` token in `.mode`, to turn the parallel-write guard off. The guard is on by default in every mode, which is a deliberate narrow exception to the legacy byte-identical-output invariant: arming it only in a v3 mode would arm it where it is redundant, since a v3 mode refuses to inject an unattested plan and an attested one already reports outside edits as tampered. The unprotected population is legacy, which is also the default.

### Changed
- The pinned `tesslio/skill-review-and-optimize` SHA moves to the current release commit (PR #215, by @popey). The old pin predated the vendor's migration to Tessl Review, so skill reviews had stopped running correctly. The range it moves across also restricts trusted optimization comments to `user.type == 'Bot'`, closing a hole in the pinned commit where any human commenter could spoof the bot's marker.
- `sync-ide-folders.py` now records which variant scripts are translator-owned. Its previous comment claimed variant scripts were language-neutral, which is false: `-de/session-catchup.py` contains German prose and five `-ar` scripts contain Arabic. `check-complete`, `init-session` and `session-catchup` are pinned as never-synced so a future full sync cannot overwrite real translations with the English canonical.

### Verification
- Suite 411 to 417. The new guard is exercised end to end through the real hook: legacy silence, forward progress silence, a regression warning with exact loss counts, no repeat once observed, both off switches, and pretool silence.
- The guard's marker lives in its own `pwf-prog` cache directory rather than `pwf-sha`, because `test_pinned_plan_shares_one_cache_slot_across_cwds` asserts one slot per plan there to catch the per-cwd-key bug from #212. The key derivation is deliberately identical, so the marker inherits the same cwd-invariance.

### Thanks
- Kunal reported the parallel-write clobber with a clear agent-interleaving diagram and offered both a revision-header design and a simpler reread rule; the simpler one is what shipped (#217).
- Alan found that the pinned Tessl action SHA predated their migration and sent the bump as a pinned SHA rather than a tag, matching how this repo pins actions (#215).
- Som audited the five language variants against the canonical skill and proved the drift #130 predicted, naming the exact 12 missing scripts and the missing UTF-8 fix. That analysis drove this release's variant work, though the variants themselves stay: they carry 39.8K of the project's 89.3K installs, and skills.sh has no pruning job, so deleting the directories would leave five permanent listings advertising an install that fails rather than removing them (#216).

## [3.9.0] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed
- **A Codex thread whose cwd was a shared parent injected an unrelated project's plan on every hook fire (closes #212, reported by @webwww123).** Plan resolution was cwd relative with no notion of a thread: `PLAN_ID`, then `.planning/.active_plan`, then the newest plan directory by mtime, every read relative to the process cwd. With `/workspace` holding one plan and `/workspace/project` holding the real one, the parent's pointer was the only pointer the hook could see, so the wrong plan arrived as high priority context on every prompt and every matched tool call, competing with the user's own corrections. Reproduced against the reporter's tree before any code changed: the parent's plan won on the canonical dispatcher and on the `.codex` Agent Skills route.
- **`PLANNING_DISABLED=1` did nothing on eleven of the thirteen hook bearing install routes.** The opt out from #195 lives in `scripts/inject-plan.sh`, and only the canonical and `.agents` SKILL.md dispatched to that script. The other eleven, the reporter's `.codex` route included, still carried the v2.43 hook body inlined in their YAML scalars. Besides missing the opt out they lacked the symlink containment guard, the SHA cache key fix, nonce delimiters, the v3 attestation refusal, the ledger summary and `PWF_INJECT=smart`, and they still wrote the SHA cache to the world writable `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/pwf-sha` that moved to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` in v3.0.0. All eleven now dispatch to the same versioned script.
- **The Stop hook could never find its script on Codex, Cursor, Factory, CodeBuddy, Mastra or OpenCode.** Those variants inherited a discovery list naming only `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` and two `$HOME/.claude/...` paths, none of which exists on those hosts, so completion checking silently did nothing.
- **Script discovery sorted its candidates instead of honoring their order.** `ls a b c | head -1` returns the alphabetically first hit, so a stale marketplace copy outranked the host native one. Discovery is now a first match wins loop.
- **A provider error made the Pi extension queue a new request (closes #211, reported by @killianMei).** `agent_end` never read its event, so a turn that ended with the provider returning an error was treated as a completed turn and got the normal auto continue follow up. That follow up started another request against the same failing provider, up to `AUTO_CONTINUE_LIMIT`, burying the original error and spending the user's retry budget. The handler now reads the trailing assistant message and returns on `stopReason` `error` or `aborted` before the counter is read or incremented. Verified against the published host packages at 0.80.3 and 0.82.1: there is no top level `stopReason`, so a guard reading one would have been undefined at runtime and would never have fired.
- **The Pi status bar stopped tracking the plan once execution was approved.** Every route to `ctx.ui.setStatus` sat on a pre approval or notify only path, so in `parity` and `cache-safe`, which `deriveEffectiveMode` selects for every non DeepSeek model, the bar kept whatever `session_start` wrote. The count is now published from `before_agent_start`, `tool_result`, `agent_end` and `session_before_compact` in every mode, including the all phases complete branch where the N/M to M/M transition reached the notification but never the bar. Bundled Pi extension 1.2.2 to 1.2.3.
- **Eight shipped PowerShell scripts could not be parsed by Windows PowerShell 5.1, so they silently did nothing on the default Windows shell.** `powershell.exe` reads a `.ps1` as ANSI unless the file carries a UTF-8 BOM, and the UTF-8 bytes for an em dash end in `0x94`, which CP1252 maps to a closing curly quote. That opens a string literal that never closes, and every dispatcher wraps its PowerShell call in fallbacks that swallow the parse error. Dead on Windows: the Cursor plan injection hook, both `.kiro` asset scripts, the Arabic `check-complete.ps1`, and `check-complete` plus `init-session` for both Chinese variants, which meant a Windows user of those variants could not create a plan at all. Every `.ps1` holding non-ASCII now carries a BOM.
- **Wall clock timestamps reached the model unnormalized on five routes** (raised in #210 by @GlitterKill): the Cursor hook and its PowerShell twin, the Codex hook, `.mastracode/hooks.json`, the Hermes plugin, and the Pi extension. The v2.40 normalization that keeps the injected `progress.md` tail stable had never been applied to any of them, because each builds its injection independently.
- **An attested plan under an absolute pin reported `[PLAN TAMPERED]` on every fire.** GNU `sha256sum` prefixes its output line with a backslash when the filename needs escaping, which any Windows style path triggers, so the parsed digest never matched the attestation.

### Added
- **`PWF_PLAN_ROOT`**, an absolute plan root binding. `PLAN_ID` is a cwd relative slug, so a thread sitting at a shared parent had no way to name a nested project's plan at all. `PWF_PLAN_ROOT=/workspace/project` pins the thread regardless of where its cwd sits. A pin that does not resolve fails closed with a notice rather than falling back to the ambiguous plan the caller was escaping. Supported by the canonical dispatcher, the Codex hook route, the Cursor hooks, and the shared resolver in both shell and PowerShell.
- **Session attachment on the SKILL.md routes**, matching the semantics the Codex adapter has carried since #146. With no `.planning/sessions/` directory present nothing changes. Honest limitation: nothing on those routes supplies a per thread `PWF_SESSION_ID`, so on hosts that never set it the guard can refuse but cannot bind.
- **Fail closed on an ambiguous cwd.** When the plan was chosen by the shared pointer or by the newest by mtime fallback rather than named explicitly, and a project directly below the root carries its own live plan, nothing is injected and the notice names both escape hatches. An explicit `PLAN_ID`, a `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` pin or an attached session stays authoritative and skips the check. Detection is one shell glob at depth one. A nested pointer that is empty or names a deleted directory does not count as competing, so an abandoned subproject cannot kill injection at the root.
- **`PWF_SCRIPT_DIR`**, an opt in override naming the skill's scripts directory, for workspace installs that no user level path can reach.
- An environment variable reference table in the README covering all seven knobs, several of which had never been documented anywhere.

### Changed
- Refusals are never silent. The session guard, the ambiguity refusal, a broken pin and a script that cannot be found each emit one line per turn naming the way out. Per tool call and precompact fires stay quiet so the notice cannot become spam. This came out of an adversarial pass: an earlier build of the session guard exited silently, which on any host that never sets `PWF_SESSION_ID` would have let a stale `.planning/sessions/` directory kill injection permanently with no symptom, and `.planning/` is gitignored so that state is invisible to review.
- `plan-doctor` reports a refusal as its own state with the remedy. It previously counted the refusal notice as bytes of plan context and printed PASS, so the one tool a dark user is pointed at gave a green light.
- `ledger-summary.sh` accepts the resolved plan directory as an argument, so a pinned autonomous run reports the pinned plan rather than the parent's phase counts. Without it a pinned loop could read `1/1 complete` while its own plan had an open phase. When no plan directory is determinable it now says so instead of reporting a confident `0/0 complete`.
- The skill text described per tool call re injection as "the +68% token tax measured in the v2.21 eval". That eval measured total tokens for a whole task with the skill against the same task without it, which is mostly the cost of writing three structured files. It never isolated recitation, and the wording now states the measured per call figure.

### Verification
- Suite 311 to 411 passing, 282 to 453 subtests, plus 48 Pi extension tests and `sync-ide-folders.py --verify` clean.
- Determinism is asserted rather than assumed: `inject-plan.sh` fired twice against an untouched fixture is byte identical in every context and every mode, including attested and autonomous. The suite proved this for the ledger summary and never for the injection script itself.
- New suites cover the nested project tree from #212 including a two thread case, injection determinism, PowerShell parseability under the real Windows interpreter, hook dispatch parity across every SKILL.md, the Codex and Cursor hook routes, and the resolver pin in both shell and PowerShell.
- The legacy invariant was verified by diffing old against new output for slug, legacy root and autonomous fixtures across all three contexts on every route touched.
- Built by Fable agents, reviewed by Opus, with a Sonnet fleet on recon and a four agent adversarial pass that returned a do not ship verdict on the first build. Four blockers, two of them introduced by the fix itself, were closed before release.

### Thanks
- webwww123 reported the shared cwd plan leak with a working reproduction, a correct reading of the resolution chain, and a fix list that shaped the order this shipped in (#212).
- killianMei traced the follow up amplification to the ignored `agent_end` event and the stale status bar to the exact handlers that never publish, with call sites (#211).
- GlitterKill asked whether plan injection breaks prompt caching, which turned up three more unnormalized routes, a token figure attached to the wrong measurement, and the Windows PowerShell parse failures (#210).

## [3.8.2] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- **Session recovery silently found nothing for any project path containing a dot, a space, or any other non-alphanumeric character (closes #209, reported by @seathatflowsinourveins).** Claude Code names `~/.claude/projects/` entries by folding every character outside `[A-Za-z0-9-]` to `-`, but three copies of `session-catchup.py` still used a manual replace chain that handled only `/`, `\` and `:`. Those copies computed a directory name Claude Code never writes, no candidate matched, and `main()` returned at the `exists()` check with exit 0, so catchup after `/clear` produced nothing and reported nothing. Hidden directories such as `~/.dotfiles` were the common case. One of the three sits on a live install route: `marketplace.json` declares `"source": "./"`, so the plugin root is the repository root and the SKILL.md restore block resolves `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/session-catchup.py` for every plugin user on Linux, macOS or Git Bash. Measured against a real store holding 89 sessions, the shipped resolver produced 0 bytes where the fixed one produces 11336 and recovers 166 messages. The root, `.hermes` and `.mastracode` copies now share the same normalize, sanitize and candidate helpers as the canonical copy, keeping their existing function names, signatures and the `.mastracode` Codex guard (`tests/test_catchup_store_resolution_parity.py`).
- **An emoji in a folder name made a project unresolvable in every copy, including the canonical one.** Claude Code walks the directory name as UTF-16, so a non-BMP character costs two dashes, while the sanitizer counted codepoints and produced one. Folding is now counted in UTF-16 code units. The rules were measured against 24 real stores whose recorded `cwd` could be read: one model matches all 24, and it also showed that current versions fold `_` while older stores kept it, so both spellings stay in the probe chain and the exact spelling is still probed first.
- The 15 copies that already folded dots keep that behavior unchanged. `.kiro` is untouched because it ships a different program that reads `.kiro/plan/` and never looks at `~/.claude/projects`.

### Security
- **Two projects whose paths fold to the same `~/.claude/projects` name could read each other's transcripts.** The mapping is lossy, so `client.acme` and `client-acme` share one directory. Until this release the resolver did not fold those characters and simply missed the directory; folding the way Claude Code folds means it now finds it, so catchup filters transcripts by the `cwd` they record. A transcript is skipped only when it positively records a different project, transcripts that record none are kept because the field is not present in every generation of the format, and a directory whose transcripts all belong to another project is reported instead of used. The filter works per session rather than rejecting the whole directory, because in a collision both projects live there permanently and rejecting it would cost the project its own history. Reproduced with a planted canary against the preceding commit and again after the fix (`tests/test_catchup_cross_project_guard.py`).

### Verification
- Suite 305 to 311 passing, 282 subtests, plus `sync-ide-folders.py --verify` clean. The new parity suite discovers the copies with `git ls-files` and runs one vector table through each, so the drift that produced #209 fails the suite instead of hiding in a single file.

### Thanks
- seathatflowsinourveins reported the dot-folding mismatch with an exact blob reference, a working reproduction, and a correct reading of the silent return path (#209).

## [3.8.1] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- **Pi extension: plan resolution no longer depends on the live shell cwd (closes #208, reported by @fd44fdg).** The Pi session cwd follows the shell, so an agent that changed into a subdirectory lost the project's plan entirely: resolution found nothing, the recitation went dark, and the "No task_plan.md found" warning fired on every write and edit. Resolution now anchors on the nearest ancestor directory that carries planning state (`.planning/` or `task_plan.md`), bounded by a `.git` repository boundary and a depth cap so a plan outside the repository can never leak into a session. Explicit `PLAN_ID` pins keep working from any subdirectory. New vitest suite covers the walk, the boundary, and the preserved precedence (`__tests__/plan-anchor.test.ts`).
- **Pi extension: every injection now states which plan it resolved** (`plan: <id>` or `plan: root`). A stale `.planning/<id>/` directory shadows a root `task_plan.md` by documented precedence (slug beats root since v2.40.0); without a visible label that shadowing was silent and users debugged the wrong plan. The label makes it visible; `set-active-plan` or deleting the stale directory remains the cure.
- **`init-session` created plans without the v3.8.0 `## Next Step` section.** The scripts write plans from an inline heredoc, not from `templates/task_plan.md`, so the section shipped in the templates never reached created plans. All 26 heredoc copies (sh and PowerShell, canonical plus every mirror) now carry it, and a regression test asserts the created output rather than the template (`test_init_session_output_contains_next_step`).

### Security
- The Pi extension resolver reached slug-validation and containment parity with the sh resolver. A traversal `PLAN_ID` such as `../../outside` resolved a plan outside `.planning/` (the sh resolver already blocked it), slug-invalid `.active_plan` targets and directory names were accepted, and a scoped winner canonicalizing outside the project (a junctioned slug directory) was followed. All four now match the sh behavior: `SLUG_RE` on every branch, `realpathSync` containment fail-closed on the resolved winner. Found independently by the Opus verification pass and the Sonnet reliability fleet that gate this release.
- Every Pi runtime consumer that takes a directory (the session-attachment gate, project mode config, attest and catchup script working directories) now routes through the same anchor as plan resolution, and the injected plan label is sanitized to `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` capped at 64 characters.

### Thanks
- fd44fdg reported the Pi cwd resolution split-brain with a precise root-cause analysis (#208).

## [3.8.0] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- **The Stop hook never fired on macOS or Linux, and was a silent no-op on every platform when `CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR` was unset.** Two dispatch bugs stacked in the SKILL.md Stop scalar: the install-path fallback used a `:-` default that can never substitute (the probed variable is always a non-empty string even when the env var is unset), and the PowerShell branch was selected on every platform because `check-complete.ps1` ships everywhere, so `powershell.exe ... 2>/dev/null` swallowed the dispatch with a suppressed exit 127 wherever PowerShell is absent. Both the legacy completion advisory and the v3 completion gate were dead in those environments. The scalar now selects targets by file existence and dispatches by platform: PowerShell only under MINGW/MSYS/CYGWIN, `sh` elsewhere, with an explicit `exit 0`. Windows output is unchanged. Patched in all 14 SKILL.md variants that carry the scalar. New tests execute the scalar end to end on both CI legs instead of string-matching its shape (`tests/test_stop_hook_dispatch.py`).
- **session-catchup looked for a `~/.claude/projects/` directory that does not exist on macOS/Linux installs, nor for any project path containing an underscore.** Claude Code keeps underscores and the leading dash of POSIX absolute paths when naming session stores; the mapper replaced `_` with `-` and stripped the leading dash, so recovery after `/clear` silently found nothing in those cases. The mapper now probes the exact spelling first, keeps both legacy spellings as fallbacks for stores created by older versions, and settles ambiguity via the cwd recorded in the newest session file. Fixed in the canonical script and every shipped copy; the drifted older-generation copies (root `scripts/`, `.hermes`, `.mastracode`) received a targeted underscore fix preserving their shape (`tests/test_catchup_project_dir.py`).
- **A stale SHA-cache hit could report a false `[PLAN TAMPERED]` for a different project.** The attestation cache key was the relative plan path, so every legacy-root project on a machine shared one slot. The key now includes the absolute project root; the cache self-heals with one extra re-hash per plan after upgrade (`tests/test_inject_smart.py`).
- **`resolve-plan-dir.ps1` reached parity with the sh resolver.** The PowerShell mirror had no slug validation on any branch, its newest-dir scan could resolve a directory without `task_plan.md` (a `sessions/` dir could win), and containment failed open when canonicalization failed. All three now match the sh resolver, including fail-closed containment. A new sh-vs-ps1 parity suite runs the same fixture trees through both resolvers on both CI legs (`tests/test_resolver_parity.py`).
- **`ledger-append.sh` could write invalid UTF-8 into the run ledger.** The summary was truncated with `cut -c1-200`, which counts bytes and can cut a CJK, Arabic, or emoji codepoint in half, producing a JSONL line that strict readers reject. Truncation now strips a trailing incomplete UTF-8 sequence, via `iconv -c` where available with a pure-sh byte-level fallback; a complete multibyte character ending exactly at the boundary survives. The PowerShell twin was confirmed character-based and aligned to the same 200 budget (`tests/test_ledger_utf8.py`).
- Line endings are now pinned: new root `.gitattributes` forces LF for `.sh`, `.py`, `.ps1`, and `.svg`, CRLF for `.cmd` and `.bat`. A CRLF-converted shell script fails under `sh` with errors that read like code bugs; the index was audited (all 175 tracked `.sh`/`.py` files already stored LF, no renormalization needed) and a regression test keeps it that way (`tests/test_line_endings.py`).

### Added
- **Opt-in structure-aware plan injection** (`PWF_INJECT=smart`, or an `inject-smart` token in `.mode`). The default `head -50` injection is position-blind: late in a long plan the in_progress phase, the decision journal, and the errors table all sit past the injected window, so every turn pays the token cost while the window no longer carries the active phase. The smart shape emits the plan title, the Goal / Next Step / Current Phase sections, a phase count, the full first in_progress phase section, and the last 3 Decisions rows, extracted in a single POSIX-awk pass. Plans without `### Phase` headings fall back to the plain head. With no opt-in the output stays byte-identical to v2.43 (`tests/test_inject_smart.py`).
- **Next Step pointer.** Both task_plan templates now carry a `## Next Step` section directly after `## Goal`, inside every head-50/head-30 injection window, and the 5-Question Reboot Test gained a sixth row: What am I about to do? A fresh session resumes at the named action instead of re-deriving it (`TemplateNextStepTests`).
- **Tool-result outcomes in session catchup.** The catchup report annotated what the previous session tried but not what happened. Tool lines now carry the matched result: `-> ok`, or `-> FAILED (first error line)`, for both Claude Code sessions (tool_result/is_error) and the OpenCode SQLite path (state.status). Result-free sessions produce byte-identical output to before, proven by a golden test captured prior to the change.
- **macOS CI leg plus a BSD-userland simulation.** The pytest matrix now includes macos-latest, and a new Linux-leg harness runs the resolver, injection, attestation, and ledger scripts end to end under a simulated BSD userland (no realpath, no readlink, no flock, no sha256sum, BSD-style stat), so a GNU-only-flag regression fails CI before it reaches a Mac (`tests/test_bsd_userland_sim.py`).
- Three problem-query documentation pages: `docs/claude-code-lost-context-after-compaction.md`, `docs/agent-forgets-plan-after-clear.md`, and `docs/long-running-agent-tasks.md`, each answering the search question in its title from repo facts only, cross-linked, with install routes (`tests/test_seo_docs_pages.py`).
- `.github/FUNDING.yml` (GitHub Sponsors listing verified active) and a social preview asset (`media/social-preview.svg` + `.png`; the upload under repository Settings remains a manual step).

### Changed
- **README rebuilt around the product's strongest evidence.** Hero tagline, seven badges in two rows replacing twenty-five in three (the hand-maintained version badge, stale at 3.5.1, is now the dynamic release badge), a before/after `/clear` demo using the skill's real injection format, two committed SVG charts built only from numbers already published in `docs/evals.md` with the internal-v1 framing baked into the images, a mermaid diagram of the hook loop, the install-route matrix at the decision point, one consolidated command table that finally lists `/plan-doctor`, a promoted three-tier platform table, a cost-honesty admonition with the real overhead numbers, a new overhead FAQ entry, and a compact repository map. The unframed comparative badge was removed; recovery numbers appear only with the internal benchmark framing. The 7.6MB banner was downscaled to a 220KB JPEG. The plan-mode FAQ answer no longer asserts anything about plan-mode internals.
- `llms.txt` rewritten as a Q&A-bearing AI-search surface mirroring the README FAQ, with the same honesty constraints enforced by a new guard test (`tests/test_llms_txt.py`).
- SEO surface: repository topics swapped (context-rot, session-recovery, claude-code-skills in; pi, copilot, developer-tools out), repository description refreshed around session recovery, compaction, and context rot, `plugin.json` keywords cleaned (clawd, clawdbot, clawdhub out; long-running-agents, session-recovery, context-rot, agent-planning in), and the CITATION.cff abstract broadened to the 60+ agent Agent Skills story.

## [3.7.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- **The repo now ships the cross-tool Agent Skills standard layout in-tree: `.agents/skills/planning-with-files/`.** Tools that read the standard path natively (Zed, Amp, Warp, Devin, Antigravity, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and the wider agentskills.io adopter list) discover the current skill from a plain `git clone` with no per-tool setup. The mirror carries the full canonical surface: SKILL.md, references, all six templates including the autonomous plan template, and the complete script set (hook dispatchers, ledger tooling, doctor). It is wired into both maintenance systems so it cannot silently rot: `sync-ide-folders.py` gained a `.agents` manifest, and the SKILL.md joined the `bump-version.py` parity set and the version-parity test (now 18 locked entries).

- **`plan-doctor.sh` now ships in every synced IDE skill folder** (`.codebuddy`, `.codex`, `.continue`, `.factory`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, and the new `.agents`), not only the two canonical `scripts/` locations.

### Changed

- **`docs/gemini.md` now recommends the Agent Skills standard path.** Gemini CLI reads `.agents/skills/` natively and that alias takes precedence, so new installs get the current, version-locked skill instead of the intentionally version-lagged `.gemini/skills/` variant, which stays in place for existing installs. Manual install methods now copy from the standard layout as well.

- `AGENTS.md` and the `bump-version.py` docstring now describe the actual parity set (18 entries including `.agents`), replacing the stale 19-file wording that predated the `.pi` and `.kiro` scheme split.

### Verification

- Full suite green (217 passed) with the `.agents` SKILL.md under version-parity lock. `sync-ide-folders.py --verify` covers the mirror's shared files from this release on.

## [3.6.0] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- **Plan resolution and hook injection went silently dark on machines with Windows-native coreutils on PATH.** A native coreutils build (for example `C:\Program Files\coreutils`, increasingly common via winget or uutils) shadows Git Bash's tools inside `sh`, and its `realpath` canonicalizes MSYS `/c/...` input to `C:\`-style backslash output. The containment guard in `resolve-plan-dir.sh` and `inject-plan.sh` compares canonical paths with a forward-slash prefix pattern, so every comparison failed: the resolver resolved nothing, `inject-plan.sh` emitted nothing, and every hook fire exited 0 with no error. The plan mechanisms this skill is built on were fully disabled on such machines with no visible symptom, and Linux CI could never reproduce it. Canonical paths are now backslash-normalized (pure-shell, no extra process) before comparison. Found live during a repo audit on a machine where 33 local tests failed while CI stayed green.

- **The resolver's containment root still canonicalized `$PWD` instead of `.`.** The v3.2.0 fix for 8.3 short-name and `/tmp`-alias mismatches landed in `inject-plan.sh` only; `resolve-plan-dir.sh` kept the old form and additionally canonicalized absolute candidates built from the `$PWD` string, which a Windows-native `realpath` does not spell the same way as a short-form process cwd. The resolver now canonicalizes the root via `.` and checks candidates through their cwd-relative form, so both sides resolve through the same physical-cwd base. Emitted output is unchanged.

- **The local `test_ledger.py` hang on Windows is gone.** Known since v3.4.1 as "hangs locally, green on CI"; it stopped reproducing once the containment comparison was fixed. The ledger suite (12 tests) now passes locally in under 15 seconds.

### Added

- **`/plan-doctor` self-check command** (`commands/plan-doctor.md`, `scripts/plan-doctor.sh`, dual-shipped and parity-tested). Every failure in this class is silent by design (hooks always exit 0), so a broken install looks identical to "no plan yet". The doctor answers, in one pass: does resolution work here and which plan wins, does injection actually emit plan context, what path shape does the canonicalizer produce (warns about the pre-v3.6.0 dark condition), is the plan attested, which install surfaces exist on this machine, and what one hook fire costs in wall-clock. From the July 2026 benchmark improvement backlog.

- **Install-route matrix and trust prerequisite in `docs/installation.md`.** The plugin route ships `commands/` and registers hooks reliably; `npx skills add` and manual skill copies ship no slash commands, and SKILL.md frontmatter hooks have been observed unregistered on project-level installs (headless Claude Code 2.1.201, July 2026 benchmark). Project trust (`hasTrustDialogAccepted`) silently gates project-level skills. Both conditions are now documented with the doctor as the verification step.

- **Belt-and-suspenders trigger line for CLAUDE.md.** The July 2026 benchmark measured unforced skill engagement at 60-67% while always-loaded rules-file instructions engaged 100%. Install docs now offer a one-line CLAUDE.md snippet that makes engagement deterministic while the skill description keeps handling discovery.

- **Regression tests for the backslash-canonicalizer class** (`tests/test_containment.py`): a PATH-prepended stub `realpath` reproduces the Windows-native output shape on every platform, so ubuntu CI now guards a Windows-only field failure.

### Changed

- **Hook fire cost dropped.** Per-candidate `grep -Eq` slug checks and `basename` calls in `resolve-plan-dir.sh` and `inject-plan.sh` were replaced with equivalent shell builtins (case patterns and parameter expansion), and the resolver computes its containment root once per run instead of once per candidate. One `inject-plan.sh` fire measures 289ms wall-clock on the same machine that measured 2.0-2.4s at v3.4.0 (July 2026 benchmark, F4). Output is byte-identical; the legacy invariant holds.

- README documents v3.6.0, adds a plan-mode handoff FAQ (how an accepted plan-mode plan becomes `task_plan.md` phases, answering the open question in #19), and updates the supported-agents answer to the current `.agents/skills/` standard landscape. The stale Manus-2025 "one tool call per turn" guidance was replaced with the 2026 parallel-host update in the last two variant copies that still carried it (`.factory`, `.mastracode`).

### Verification

- Full suite green locally on the machine that reproduced the bug: 205 passed plus 12 ledger tests, 5 skipped, 0 failed (was 33 failed before the fix). Live smoke: `sh scripts/inject-plan.sh` emits plan context in a repo with an active plan, `scripts/plan-doctor.sh` reports PASS on resolution and injection with the Windows-native canonicalizer present.

## [3.5.1] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- **Codex Windows hook resolver defaulted to the WSL bash launcher** (extracted from PR #207 by @mahdiit). The shell resolver in `codex_hook_adapter` preferred `C:\Windows\System32\bash.exe`, the WSL launcher, whenever Git Bash's `usr\bin` was not on PATH, the default Git for Windows install layout. On machines where WSL is present but no distro is installed, a common Docker Desktop setup, that launcher exists on disk but fails immediately, so every shell hook silently failed. This is why #201 and #204 kept resurfacing on some Windows machines even after those releases shipped. The resolver now skips WSL launchers, both the System32 binary and the Microsoft Store WindowsApps alias, and continues on to the Git for Windows probe.

- **`pwf-hook.cmd` lost the Python interpreter under Codex's reduced PATH** (also from PR #207). Codex starts hooks with a trimmed environment, so the launcher's plain `py -3` / `python` lookup often found nothing. `pwf-hook.cmd` now honors a `PYTHON_BIN` override, probes the standard `uv` and CPython install locations, and quotes the interpreter path so installs under a path containing spaces still resolve.

- **Pi extension 1.2.1: pre-tool recitations and the tamper notice were consumed by interactive tool dialogs** (#206, diagnosed with the exact mechanism by @jschmied). The `tool_call` hook delivered queued planning text as steer, but when an interactive tool such as AskUserQuestion blocked the turn on its own custom UI, the steer text was read as the dialog's answer instead of reaching the model. Recitations and the tamper notice are now delivered as `nextTurn`, landing after the interactive tool releases the turn instead of being swallowed by it. Bundled Pi extension bumped to 1.2.1.

- **Two test-portability failures surfaced by the first hosted-runner run** (PR #198 by @Yigtwxx, test files only, no production script changes). `tests/test_containment.py` canonicalized the resolver's Git Bash POSIX path with `os.path.realpath`, which read `/tmp/...` as `C:\tmp` and failed the escaping-symlink containment assertion on symlink-capable `windows-latest`; a `host_realpath()` helper now maps the path back with `cygpath` before comparing. `tests/test_path_fix.py` ran two Windows-shaped path vectors on `ubuntu-latest`, where `Path.resolve()` treats `C:/...` as relative and prepends the CWD; both now skip unless `os.name == "nt"`, the only platform where that input shape is meaningful. In both cases the resolver rejected the escape correctly and only the test comparison was wrong.

### Added

- **CI test workflow** (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`, PR #199 by @Yigtwxx, closes #197). Runs the pytest suite on `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest` (Python 3.12) plus the Pi extension vitest suite on `ubuntu-latest` (Node 22), on every pull request and push to master. Until now the only CI was the Tessl skill-prose review, so nothing ran the 200+ pytest tests or the 21 Pi vitest tests that CONTRIBUTING.md asks contributors to run before opening a PR. The `windows-latest` leg targets the recurring Windows regression class (the v3.2.0 audit found `session-catchup.py` silently non-functional on Windows). Workflow permissions are `contents: read` only, `fail-fast: false` keeps a Windows-only failure visible instead of masked by a cancel, and an explicit step asserts `sh` is on PATH so the roughly ten hook tests that skip without it cannot silently drop coverage.

### Verification

- Python suite green on master before merge (200 passed, 5 skipped on a non-symlink-capable Windows host). Contributor's hosted-runner run on PR #199 green on all three jobs: pytest on ubuntu with symlink containment tests running, the equivalent profile on windows, and 21 vitest.
- Supply-chain review on PR #198 and #199: no new runtime dependencies, no install scripts, no bin shims. The workflow installs `pytest` and `pyyaml` for the pytest job and runs `npm install` against the Pi extension's existing devDependencies (vitest, typescript, @types/node). It uses `pull_request` (not `pull_request_target`), so fork PRs run with a read-only token and no secret access.

### Thanks

- Mahdi (@mahdiit) for producing the Codex Windows WSL bash launcher fix and the Windows Python discovery hardening (PR #207), using Codex Terra after v3.4.1 still failed to clear the hook errors on his own machine.
- jschmied for diagnosing #206 down to the exact runtime location, steer delivered recitations consumed by AskUserQuestion's interactive dialog, and for the `nextTurn` delivery fix that shipped.
- Yigtwxx (Yiğit) for filing the CI gap (#197) and landing both the test-portability fixes (#198) and the pytest plus vitest workflow (#199).

## [3.5.0] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed

- **Codex hooks on Windows emitted invalid JSON and failed on Unicode** (PR #205 by @yolo0731, closes #204). On Windows the Codex front door forwarded plain `[planning-with-files]` stdout where Codex expects `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit) or a common-fields object (PreCompact), so those hooks were rejected. UTF-8 plan text also broke twice, once decoding shell output through the Windows code page in `subprocess.run(text=True)` and again writing `ensure_ascii=False` JSON through cmd.exe. The fix serializes each event in its supported Codex JSON shape with ASCII-safe output, decodes shell output as UTF-8 with `errors="replace"`, routes PreToolUse plan text through model-visible `additionalContext`, resolves scoped `.planning/<slug>/` plans in PermissionRequest, adds `clear|compact` to the SessionStart matcher, and writes the `.active_plan` pointer as UTF-8 without a BOM. The containment resolver also now fails closed when canonicalization is unavailable. 34 files, with the three-file script triple applied identically across every adapter copy. Scope is Windows Codex, matching the report.

- **Closed and complete plans kept nagging "Task incomplete" in the Pi extension** (#203, reported by @ziyu4huang). `resolveNewestPlanDir` ranked plan directories by directory mtime, which does not change when a `task_plan.md`'s contents are edited, so a finished plan lost to an older incomplete sibling and `agent_end` nagged with that sibling's stale count. Resolution now ranks by the `task_plan.md` file mtime. The extension also had no close-marker awareness: `readPlanStatus` now parses the pwf close marker and exposes `status.closed`, `agent_end` returns early on a closed plan, and the auto-continue loop stops on close. A `PWF_DEBUG` diagnostic logs the resolved cwd, plan id, closed state, and phase count before the nag. Bundled Pi extension bumped to 1.2.0.

- **Four language commands invoked a skill namespace that does not exist.** `commands/plan-ar.md`, `plan-de.md`, `plan-es.md`, and `plan-zh.md` referenced `planning-with-files-<lang>:planning-with-files-<lang>`; the skills are registered under the single plugin namespace `planning-with-files:planning-with-files-<lang>`, which the English commands already used. Corrected all four.

### Added

- **Traditional Chinese slash command** (`commands/plan-zht.md`, `/plan-zht`). The `planning-with-files-zht` skill shipped without a matching command; this closes the ar/de/es/zh/zht command parity gap.

- **README now documents the full v3 command, hook, and mode surface.** The visible command table listed only three commands with v2.11.0 and v2.15.0 tags while the plugin ships `plan-goal`, `plan-loop`, `plan-attest`, `pwf`, and the language commands. Added visible sections for the Claude Code and Pi command tables, a v3 long-running-agent features section, a hooks-and-modes reference across Claude Code, Codex, and Pi, and a "command names vs skill names" note that states there is no `/pwf-de` or `/planning-with-files:planning-with-files-goal`. All additive.

- **Plan lifecycle is now documented** (#202, asked by @kcinzgg). `docs/workflow.md` gains an "After Completion" section stating that planning files are ephemeral working memory, gitignored by default, and not archived automatically, with guidance on retaining a completed plan and a note that a completion-triggered archive step is a welcome opt-in extension. Pointers added in `docs/quickstart.md` and the README FAQ. This writes down the intent that issue #14 answered informally.

### Security

- Independent supply-chain audit of PR #205 before merge (a classifier plus two adversarial containment passes, all clean): no new dependencies, no install scripts, no bin shims, no network calls, no eval of untrusted input. The one security-relevant change (containment moving from fail-open to fail-closed) is a hardening, covered by an added junction-escape rejection test.

### Thanks

- @yolo0731 for the Codex Windows hook fix (#204, PR #205), the protocol-safe JSON serialization and the UTF-8 handling.
- @ziyu4huang for the precise #203 diagnosis, verified against the extension's own exported functions.
- @kcinzgg for the #202 question that surfaced the undocumented plan lifecycle.

## [3.4.1] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed

- **Codex hooks failed on Windows with "hook exited with code 1"** (closes #201, reported by @mahdiit). Every hook in `.codex/hooks.json` carried only a POSIX `command` (`sh`, `python3`, `2>/dev/null`, `$HOME`, a trailing `|| true`). Codex on Windows runs that string through the native command interpreter, not a POSIX shell, so `python3` hit the Microsoft Store alias, `2>/dev/null` was an invalid path, and the `|| true` success guard itself failed because `true` is not a Windows command. The chain exited non-zero and Codex reported the hook as failed on every Bash call. Reproduced on Windows: the PostToolUse command exits 1 when Git's `usr\bin` (home of `sh` and `true`) is not on PATH, which is the default Git for Windows layout.

### Added

- **Windows hook execution for Codex** via the per-hook `commandWindows` override, the mechanism OpenAI's hooks documentation sanctions. The POSIX `command` is untouched, so macOS and Linux stay byte-for-byte unchanged. On Windows all seven hooks route through a new launcher, `.codex/hooks/pwf-hook.cmd`, which selects a real Python (`py -3`, falling back to `python`, never the Store `python3` alias) and always exits 0 so an advisory hook cannot surface an error. The four Python hooks run their entry point directly; the three shell hooks route through a new front door, `.codex/hooks/run_sh.py`. `codex_hook_adapter.run_shell_script` now resolves the Git for Windows `sh.exe` by anchoring on `git.exe` and the standard install roots, so the shell scripts run even when Git's `usr\bin` is off PATH, and it hands `session-catchup.py` a real interpreter through `PYTHON_BIN`. Without Git for Windows the three shell hooks degrade to a silent no-op instead of an error, and the four Python hooks still work. The `docs/codex.md` Windows section was rewritten (it previously stated hooks were disabled on Windows).

### Verification

- Codex hook suites green: `tests/test_codex_hooks.py` (11 tests, including a cross-platform guard that every hook declares a `commandWindows` free of the POSIX tokens that break on Windows, and a Windows-only end-to-end test of the `run_sh.py` front door) and `tests/test_codex_session_isolation.py` (6 tests). Version parity and frontmatter suites green after the bump. End-to-end on Windows: PostToolUse, SessionStart, and PreToolUse all exit 0 with correct output, including a simulation of the reporter's environment (Git installed, `usr\bin` off PATH) where the `git.exe` anchor resolves `sh`, and a no-Git case that degrades to a silent no-op.
- Supply-chain review: no new runtime dependencies, no install scripts, no bin shims. Two new files under `.codex/hooks/` (`pwf-hook.cmd`, `run_sh.py`), both Windows-only entry points that reuse the existing adapter and shell scripts.

### Thanks

- @mahdiit (Mahdi) for reporting the Codex Windows hook failure (#201) with the exact error and environment.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- **`PLANNING_DISABLED=1` per-invocation opt-out** (closes #195, reported by @marcmuon). One-shot sessions that share a working directory with an active plan (a CI review bot run via `codex exec`, a read-only research agent, a nested orchestrator) were hijacked by the hooks: plan context injected, the actual output redirected into `progress.md`, and a fabricated completed phase appended to `task_plan.md`. All Codex hook entry points (`session-start.sh`, `user-prompt-submit.sh`, `pre-tool-use.sh`, `post-tool-use.sh`, `stop.sh`, `pre-compact.sh`, plus the Python adapter route via `codex_hook_adapter.is_session_attached`) and the canonical dispatchers (`inject-plan.sh`, `gate-stop.sh`, `check-complete.sh`/`.ps1`) now exit before reading the plan when `PLANNING_DISABLED=1` is set in the environment. PreToolUse still emits its allow decision so tool calls proceed normally. The guard ships in every distributed copy: canonical scripts, the skill package, all sync-managed IDE mirrors, the five language variants, the standalone `.kiro` copy, and the `clawhub-upload` bundle. Usage documented in `docs/codex.md`. New `tests/test_planning_disabled_optout.py` (12 tests) covers baseline behavior, disabled behavior, the #195 acceptance criterion (plan files byte-for-byte unchanged after a full disabled hook pass), and a guard-presence sweep across every copy.

### Fixed

- **`docs/codex.md` still described the pre-v3.1.0 blocking Stop hook.** The hook table said Stop "blocks once when phases are incomplete"; that block path was removed in v3.1.0 (PR #180) and the installed hook has emitted an advisory reminder since. The row now matches the shipped behavior. The `decision: block` half of #195 was reported against a v2.41.0 bundle shipped by oh-my-codex; current releases do not block.

### Verification

- Python suite: 200 passed, 5 skipped, 0 failed (12 new opt-out tests).
- Functional smoke test on a live temp plan: baseline injection unchanged without the variable; with it set, no hook output, tool calls still allowed, plan files byte-identical afterwards.
- `scripts/sync-ide-folders.py --verify`: all IDE folders in sync. All modified `.sh` files pass `sh -n`; all modified `.ps1` files parse clean.

### Thanks

- @marcmuon (Marc Kelechava) for the precise report separating this failure from #178 and #146, with reproductions for both symptoms, the root-cause file list, and acceptance criteria this release implements directly (#195).

## [3.3.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- **`/plan-execute` approval gate for the Pi extension** (PR #193 by @Dikshj, closes #190, requested by @lazyst). The Pi extension hooks previously activated as soon as `task_plan.md` existed on disk: plan injection on `before_agent_start`, pre-tool recitation on `tool_call`, post-write reminders on `tool_result`, and auto-continue on `agent_end` could all start while the user was still reviewing a draft plan. The extension now stays passive until the user approves the active plan with `/plan-execute`; before approval it shows a status line ("run /plan-execute to activate hooks") and nothing else. Approval is scoped to the current session and plan path, is cleared on session lifecycle events, and `/plan-execute reset` returns the plan to passive review mode. A plan whose SHA-256 attestation shows tampering cannot be approved. This gates initial hook activation only; the v3 gate mode (which gates stopping on an incomplete plan) is unchanged. Pi docs, Pi skill docs, and runtime tests cover the passive review flow.

### Verification

- Python suite: 188 passed, 5 skipped, 0 failed.
- Pi extension vitest suite: 21 passed (2 files).
- `scripts/sync-ide-folders.py --verify`: all IDE folders in sync.
- Supply-chain review on PR #193: no new dependencies, no install scripts, no bin shims, no network calls; changes confined to the Pi extension runtime, its tests, and documentation. The gate itself tightens the injection path, since a tampered or unreviewed plan can no longer reach model context automatically.

### Thanks

- @Dikshj (diksha) for implementing the /plan-execute approval gate with runtime and docs test coverage (PR #193).
- @lazyst for the feature request and the precise passive-until-confirmed workflow description (#190).

## [3.2.0] - 2026-07-03

A repository health audit covering the v3 long-running-session mechanism, the
open issue backlog, and two community pull requests. The headline finding:
`session-catchup.py`, the mechanism behind "resume after /clear," did nothing
on Windows. Both that and a related silent-injection bug are fixed here,
along with the false "0/0 phases" status reported in #191.

### Fixed

- **`session-catchup.py` was non-functional on Windows** (the "resume after /clear" feature). `get_project_dir_claude` only replaced forward slashes, so a Windows-style path (`C:\Users\...` or Git Bash's `/c/Users/...`) never sanitized to Claude's actual project-directory name, and the function always returned early with no output and no error. Three `open()` calls also had no explicit encoding, so a session log containing any non-ASCII text raised `UnicodeDecodeError` on Windows' default `cp1252` codec, an error the surrounding `except` clauses swallowed silently. Fixed by detecting Windows-shaped paths before sanitizing and adding `encoding='utf-8', errors='replace'` to the three reads; genuine Unix absolute paths take the same code path as before. `tests/test_path_fix.py` previously reimplemented the sanitizer instead of importing the real module, so the suite stayed green while the shipped script stayed broken; it now imports and exercises the actual function.
- **`inject-plan.sh`'s containment guard silently dropped plan injection and tamper detection under aliased paths.** `is_within_root()` canonicalized the project root from the `$PWD` string but canonicalized candidates from a relative path, and on a Windows account with an 8.3 short-name `TEMP` (or any path reached through the MSYS `/tmp` mount), the two resolve to differently-spelled versions of the same directory. The prefix-match check then failed and the hook exited with zero output: no plan re-injection, no tamper warning, nothing visible. Fixed by canonicalizing the root the same way candidates already are.
- **Task plans without `### Phase` headings falsely reported "0/0 phases complete"** (#191, reported by @mixian939 against Codex). `check-complete.sh`/`.ps1` and several IDE-specific Stop hooks counted `### Phase` headings but never checked whether the count was zero before reporting a status, so an unstructured `task_plan.md` produced a false "Task in progress (0/0 phases complete)" message, or in Cursor and GitHub Copilot's adapters an auto-continue nudge to keep working on a plan that was never structured to begin with. Fixed with a `TOTAL=0` guard everywhere the pattern appeared: the canonical Claude Code scripts, `.codex`, `.cursor`, GitHub Copilot's `agent-stop.sh`, all `sync-ide-folders.py`-managed IDE mirrors, the five language-variant skills, and the standalone `.kiro` copy.
- **`--template analytics` silently produced the default templates instead of the analytics-specific ones** (addresses #103). `templates/analytics_task_plan.md` and `templates/analytics_findings.md` (added v2.29.0) were never copied into `skills/planning-with-files/templates/`, the directory the installed skill package actually reads, so every plugin or skill-only install fell back to the generic templates. Copied both files into the canonical templates directory and added them to `sync-ide-folders.py`'s sync list, backfilling seven IDE mirrors.
- **Windows test suite encoding errors and stale installation docs** (PR #187 by @Stephen-abc). `subprocess.run`/`Popen` calls across 15 test files had no explicit encoding, which raises `UnicodeDecodeError` on Windows accounts whose default codepage isn't UTF-8. `docs/adal.md`, `docs/antigravity.md`, `docs/kilocode.md`, and `docs/openclaw.md` also referenced `.adal/`, `.agent/`, and `.kilocode/` source paths removed in v2.24.0, and antigravity.md's templates were mislabeled as living in `references/` instead of `templates/`. Fixed the same mislabel in `docs/codebuddy.md`, which was outside PR #187's scope.
- **Hermes adapter test failed on Windows accounts with an 8.3-short-name `TEMP`.** The test compared a `Path.resolve()`-canonicalized production result against an unresolved expected path, so accounts where `TEMP` itself resolves to a short-name alias (`OASRVA~1` vs the real account name) failed a test that was actually passing correctly. Resolved the expected side the same way.
- **`AGENTS.md` told agents to squash-merge contributor PRs.** `git merge --squash` reassigns the contributor's commit authorship to whoever runs the local commit: the exact mistake this project's release protocol already exists to prevent (v2.40.1 cycle). Replaced with cherry-pick / `gh pr merge --rebase` guidance, matching CLAUDE.md. Also documented that `.pi` and `.kiro` lag the parity-locked version bump alongside `.continue` and `.gemini`, which recent CHANGELOG entries already assumed AGENTS.md said.

### Added

- **`docs/autohand.md`** (PR #192 by @igorcosta): setup guide for Autohand Code, added to the supported-IDEs table (18+ platforms).
- **`SECURITY.md`** and GitHub private vulnerability reporting enabled (closes #188, requested by @AvitalAviv).

### Changed

- Version bumped to 3.2.0 across the 17 parity-locked files via `scripts/bump-version.py`. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, and `.kiro` lag intentionally, now documented in AGENTS.md itself.

### Verification

- Python suite: 186 passed, 5 skipped, 0 failed (up from 184/4/0; two new path-sanitizer tests in `test_path_fix.py`).
- `scripts/sync-ide-folders.py --verify`: all IDE folders in sync.
- Functionally re-verified the long-running-session mechanism end to end on Windows after the fixes: init, check-complete, attestation lock/tamper-detect/clear, parallel-plan resolution, and session-catchup all confirmed working in both sh and PowerShell.
- Supply-chain review on both merged PRs: docs and test files only, no dependency, install script, or bin shim in either.

### Thanks

- @mixian939 for the detailed #191 report and root-cause diagnosis against Codex, which led to finding and fixing the same defect in the canonical scripts and two other IDE adapters.
- @Stephen-abc (Wang Jun) for the Windows test encoding fix and installation doc corrections (PR #187).
- @igorcosta (Igor Costa, Autohand) for the Autohand Code setup docs (PR #192).
- @AvitalAviv for flagging the missing private vulnerability disclosure channel (#188).
- @mvanhorn for the original analytics templates (v2.29.0, #103) that this release finally ships into the installed skill package.

## [3.1.3] - 2026-06-16

A hotfix for a frontmatter regression introduced in v3.1.2. The refreshed description shipped in v3.1.2 contains a colon, and the English SKILL.md carry the `description` field unquoted, so the frontmatter became invalid YAML. This release quotes the description and adds a test that validates every SKILL.md frontmatter as YAML, so the class cannot ship again.

### Fixed

- **SKILL.md frontmatter was invalid YAML in v3.1.2** (regression from the v3.1.2 description refresh). The new description "Manus-style persistent file-based planning for AI coding agents: keeps ..." contains a colon followed by a space. The English SKILL.md carry `description` unquoted, so a YAML loader reads the `: ` as a nested mapping and rejects the frontmatter with "mapping values are not allowed here". This affected the canonical file and the seven English IDE variants (`.codebuddy`, `.codex`, `.cursor`, `.factory`, `.hermes`, `.mastracode`, `.opencode`) and could break skill loading and the model-triggering description field. The description is now wrapped in double quotes, matching the already-quoted translated variants. The parsed value is identical, so model triggering is unchanged. The `clawhub-upload` staging bundle was corrected the same way.

### Added

- **Frontmatter validation test** (`tests/test_skill_frontmatter_valid.py`): loads every `SKILL.md` frontmatter as YAML and asserts a non-empty string description, plus a dependency-free check that no unquoted description contains `: `. The version-parity check is a regex and could not catch this regression.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 3.1.3 across the 17 parity-locked files via `scripts/bump-version.py`. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, and `.kiro` lag intentionally per AGENTS.md release scope.

### Verification

- Python suite: 184 passed, 4 skipped, 0 failed, up from 180 with the four new frontmatter assertions.
- Every SKILL.md in the repo, including the translated variants and the lagging `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, and `.kiro` variants, parses as valid YAML.

## [3.1.2] - 2026-06-16

A documentation patch. The session-catchup command in the skill body assumed the plugin runtime had set `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, so a skill-only install that ran the documented command in a normal shell got an empty variable and a broken path. This release adds a fallback across the affected variants, fixes the same class of bug in the `.hermes` variant, and refreshes the skill description to lead with the current positioning.

### Fixed

- **Session-catchup command works outside the plugin runtime** (PR #186 by @shunfeng8421, closes #185). The documented Restore Context command ran `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/session-catchup.py`, but `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is only set when the plugin runtime executes a hook, not in an interactive shell. A skill-only install (via `npx skills add`, or on Codex or Cursor) collapsed the command to an absolute `/scripts/...` path that does not exist. The fix uses `SKILL_DIR="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.claude/skills/planning-with-files}"`, so plugin users keep the variable and skill-only users fall back to the default install path. Applied to the canonical file, the `.codebuddy` variant (with its own `${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}`), and the five language variants. The Windows PowerShell block and plugin behavior are unchanged.
- **`.hermes` variant carried the same unset-variable bug** (maintainer follow-up to #186). `.hermes` used `$HERMES_HOME` in bash and `$env:HERMES_HOME` in PowerShell with no fallback, so its catchup command failed the same way outside the Hermes runtime. Both blocks now fall back to `$HOME/.hermes` and `$env:USERPROFILE\.hermes` while keeping the runtime variable as the priority.

### Changed

- **Skill description refreshed for discoverability.** The eight English SKILL.md files (canonical plus the `.codebuddy`, `.codex`, `.cursor`, `.factory`, `.hermes`, `.mastracode`, `.opencode` adapters) now lead with "persistent file-based planning for AI coding agents" and name context-loss survival explicitly. The `Use when` trigger clause is unchanged, so model invocation behavior is identical. The five translated variants keep their localized descriptions.
- Version bumped to 3.1.2 across the 17 parity-locked files via `scripts/bump-version.py`. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, and `.kiro` lag intentionally per AGENTS.md release scope.

### Verification

- Python suite: 180 passed, 4 skipped, 0 failed, unchanged. The change is documentation prose with no test dependency.
- Supply-chain review: the changed files are SKILL.md documentation only. No dependency, install hook, bin shim, or new install-path file. PR #186's diff was reviewed line by line before adoption.

### Thanks

- @shunfeng8421 for the session-catchup fallback fix (PR #186), which resolves the #185 report.
- @xwang118 for surfacing the underlying problem in PR #183 that became #185.

## [3.1.1] - 2026-06-15

A documentation-only patch. The Codex verification command in `docs/codex.md` checked for a feature-flag name that current Codex no longer prints, so a correctly configured user running the documented check was told to upgrade. This release fixes the command and its follow-up sentence to match the canonical `hooks` flag already documented elsewhere in the same file. No code, hook, script, or test changed; the parity set is bumped to 3.1.1.

### Fixed

- **Codex verification command checks the canonical `hooks` feature flag** (PR #184 by @Fat-Jan). The Verification block ran `codex features list | rg '^codex_hooks\s'`, but Codex moved its canonical feature key from `codex_hooks` to `hooks` in 0.129.0 (openai/codex#20522). The old key still resolves as a deprecated alias inside `config.toml`, yet `codex features list` prints only the canonical `hooks`, so the bare `^codex_hooks\s` pattern matched nothing on any current Codex and routed correctly configured users to the "upgrade Codex" path. The command is now `rg '^(hooks|codex_hooks)\s'` and the troubleshooting sentence reads "If neither `hooks` nor the deprecated alias `codex_hooks` appears". This aligns the Verification block with the `hooks = true` configuration guidance and the deprecated-alias note already carried in the same document since v2.39.0.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 3.1.1 across the 17 parity-locked files via `scripts/bump-version.py`. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, and `.kiro` lag intentionally per AGENTS.md release scope.

### Verification

- Python suite: 180 passed, 4 skipped, 0 failed, unchanged from v3.1.0. A documentation-only change touches no test path.
- Supply-chain review: the single changed file is `docs/codex.md`, a two-line edit to a fenced shell command and one prose sentence. No dependency, install hook, bin shim, or new file in the install path.

### Thanks

- @Fat-Jan for catching that the Codex verification command checked a feature-flag name current Codex no longer emits (PR #184).

## [3.1.0] - 2026-06-13

This release adopts four community contributions filed against the v3.0.0 cycle, each preserving the contributor as commit author. The Codex adapter gets the Stop-hook behavior fix that issue #178 asked for plus the PreCompact parity it was missing, the Pi extension gains a real test suite, and the SHA-cache documentation is corrected to the v3 path. With no v3 mode marker on disk the canonical hooks remain byte-identical to v2.43.0.

### Fixed

- **Codex Stop hook no longer blocks a normal stop on an incomplete plan** (PR #180 by @2023Anita, closes #178). `.codex/hooks/stop.py` previously emitted `{"decision": "block"}` on the first stop while phases were still pending and `stop_hook_active` was false, which pushed the Codex agent to continue into the next phase without the user asking. The conditional block path is removed: the adapter now emits a single advisory `systemMessage`, and `.codex/hooks/stop.sh` drops the imperative "continue working on the remaining phases" wording in favor of a plain progress-sync reminder. This matches the v3 design principle that an incomplete plan alone never blocks a stop. The standalone `.codex` Stop adapter performs only phase counting, with no attestation or tamper gate to preserve, so removing the block path is the complete fix for the reported behavior.
- **SHA-cache documentation corrected to the v3 location** (PR #174 by @mvanhorn, closes #164). The new `docs/perf-notes.md` documents the attestation SHA cache: location priority, key derivation, container and CI behavior, and the clear command. A maintainer follow-up updated the documented path from the v2.40 `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/pwf-sha` location to the v3 priority chain (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/pwf-sha`, then `$HOME/.cache/pwf-sha`, then the `/tmp` fallback only when HOME is unset, per `scripts/inject-plan.sh`), corrected the clear command and the container premise, and clarified that the cache key is the first 16 hex characters of the SHA-256 of the plan file path. The canonical SKILL.md cross-link that repeated the stale `/tmp` path was fixed in the same pass.

### Added

- **Native Codex PreCompact hook** (PR #181 by @GongYuanCaiJi). The `.codex/hooks.json` lifecycle wiring declared every event except PreCompact, while the canonical SKILL.md has carried PreCompact since v3.0.0. This adds `.codex/hooks/pre-compact.sh` (POSIX sh, reuses `resolve-plan-dir.sh`, emits the same progress-flush reminder and `Plan-SHA256` line as the canonical hook), wires it into `.codex/hooks.json`, corrects the `docs/codex.md` hook table, and adds two targeted tests. This is parity for the native `hooks.json` route, not a new user-visible capability: the hook stays dormant on a runtime that never fires a PreCompact event, and the `|| true` wiring cannot break a session.
- **Pi extension integration test suite** (PR #175 by @mvanhorn, closes #163). A TypeScript (vitest) suite under `.pi/skills/planning-with-files/extensions/planning-with-files/__tests__/` exercises all eight Pi lifecycle handlers, the four runtime modes (auto, parity, cache-safe, notify), and the SHA-256 attestation gate across match, mismatch, and invalid-hash cases. A maintainer follow-up aligned one parity-mode assertion with the runtime's lowercase injection banner in `runtime.ts`.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 3.1.0 across the 17 parity-locked files via `scripts/bump-version.py`. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, and `.kiro` lag intentionally per AGENTS.md release scope.

### Verification

- Python suite: 180 passed, 4 skipped (the pre-existing Windows exec-bit and symlink-containment skips), 0 failed, up from 178 with the two new Codex PreCompact tests. `tests/test_codex_hooks.py` reports 9 passed.
- The Pi extension vitest suite (PR #175) was added and statically reviewed against `runtime.ts` source, but was not executed in this release environment; `python -m pytest` does not run the `.test.ts` files. Run `npm install && npm test` inside `.pi/skills/planning-with-files/extensions/planning-with-files/` to execute it. The `package.json` is `private`, declares only `vitest`, `typescript`, and `@types/node` as devDependencies, and carries no install lifecycle scripts.
- Supply-chain review of the two new shipped files: `.codex/hooks/pre-compact.sh` is POSIX sh with no network calls, no install hooks, and no writes outside the plan directory; `docs/perf-notes.md` is documentation only.

### Thanks

- @2023Anita for the Codex Stop hook fix (PR #180) that resolves the issue #178 auto-continuation complaint.
- @GongYuanCaiJi for the native Codex PreCompact parity hook (PR #181).
- @mvanhorn for the Pi extension integration test suite (PR #175, closes #163) and the SHA-cache documentation (PR #174, closes #164).

## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-10

v3 targets long-running agentic runs on strong models (Opus 4.8, Fable 5, GPT 5.5 class). Everything new is opt-in. With no mode marker on disk, the hooks produce byte-identical v2.43.0 output: same delimiters, same raw progress tail, same advisory Stop behavior. Existing workflows need no changes.

### Added

- **Autonomous mode** (`init-session.sh --autonomous`): keeps the turn-start plan injection, drops the per-tool-call re-injection that the v2.21 eval measured as a 68 percent token tax. The plan file on disk stays the source of truth. Recitation is reduced, not removed: published evidence on goal drift in long runs still supports one injection per turn.
- **Gated mode** (`init-session.sh --gated`): adds a deliberate completion gate on the Stop hook. The gate blocks a stop only when all five conditions hold: the plan opted into gated mode, a phase is `in_progress`, `stop_hook_active` is false, the block count is under the cap (default 20, `PWF_GATE_CAP` to override, reset at init), and the run ledger advanced since the previous block. Any single failure lets the stop through. An incomplete plan alone never blocks a session, which is the design lesson from issue #178.
- **Run ledger**: `ledger-append`, `ledger-summary`, and `phase-status` scripts (sh and ps1). Workers append one JSON line per event to a per-agent `ledger-<agent>.jsonl`; the injected context becomes a fixed-shape synthesized summary (tick count, phases complete, in-progress phase, last event per agent) instead of a raw `progress.md` tail. The block carries no timestamps and no free text from disk, so it stays stable for the host prompt cache.
- **Autonomous plan template** (`templates/task_plan_autonomous.md`) with optional per-phase `DependsOn`, `Owner`, and `AcceptanceCheck` fields next to the existing `Status` line, so v2 completion counting is unchanged.
- **Migration guide**: MIGRATION.md gains a v2-to-v3 section with the host capability tiers (hard block: Claude Code, Codex CLI, Continue.dev; follow-up inject: Cursor, Pi, Kiro; notify only: OpenCode, Gemini CLI) and an honest note that OpenCode cannot enforce the gate until upstream ships Stop-hook re-activation.
- **Tests**: new suites for the gate decision table, ledger append and summary, init modes, realpath containment, and script location parity. Suite total: 178 passed, 4 skipped.

### Changed

- The four giant hook one-liners in SKILL.md frontmatter are now thin dispatchers that call `scripts/inject-plan.sh` and `scripts/gate-stop.sh`. In legacy mode the dispatcher output is byte-identical to the v2.43 inline commands, verified by diffing both against the same fixtures.
- The mtime-keyed SHA cache moved from the shared `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/pwf-sha` to the user-private `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/pwf-sha` (default `~/.cache/pwf-sha`). The first session after upgrade rehashes attested plans once, then the cache repopulates.
- The version parity test no longer fails on fresh clones that lack the gitignored `clawhub-upload/` staging folder. Contributors hit this as a phantom failure when running the full suite against a clean checkout.

### Security

- v3 modes refuse to inject an unattested plan body. Autonomous and gated sessions attest the plan at init, and editing the plan afterward requires an explicit re-attest. An unattended loop never feeds an unverified plan into context.
- Per-session nonce delimiters in v3 modes (`===BEGIN-PLAN-DATA-<nonce>===`) replace the static markers, which makes delimiter-confusion injection harder. The limitation is documented in SKILL.md: an attacker with plan-write access can read the nonce, so attestation, not the nonce, is the defense there.
- The raw `progress.md` tail is no longer injected in v3 modes. `progress.md` is not covered by attestation, so instruction-like text appended there during an unattended run used to reach the model context every turn.
- Realpath containment in the plan-dir resolver: a symlinked plan directory that escapes the project root is treated as unresolved instead of being hashed and injected.
- The attestation writer closes a read-then-write integrity gap and handles the PowerShell 5.1 BOM case that could brick attestation files written on stock Windows.

### Fixed

- All 12 findings from the pre-release adversarial review, including control characters in gate block reasons breaking the Stop-hook JSON, a `stop_hook_active` false positive, mode token parsing, and missing dispatcher scripts on the plugin-marketplace path.
- The ledger script trio now ships in root `scripts/` as well, so the plugin-marketplace fallback route gets the structured ledger summary instead of silently falling back to the raw progress tail. A new location-parity test pins the full dual-shipped script set byte-identical in both locations.

## [2.43.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- **CONTRIBUTING.md at repo root** (PR #171 by @Skulli485, closes issue #162): first-time contributor guide covering local setup, project layout, PR submission conventions, authorship and credit policy, language variant contribution rules, and where to ask questions. Pre-merge follow-up commit removed a duplicated intro and a broken code fence that the original diff carried. GitHub auto-surfaces the file in the PR creation flow now.

### Fixed

- **OpenCode docs broken install/verify paths** (Issue #172 by @luyanfeng): `docs/opencode.md` referenced `planning-with-files/planning-with-files/SKILL.md` (doubled folder segment) in the manual-install block, the `cat` usage block, and both verification `ls` commands. The path assumed a full-repo clone into the skills directory rather than a direct file copy of the `.opencode/skills/planning-with-files/` subtree. v2.43.0 replaces the manual-install Quick Install with `npx skills add` (matching every other IDE doc) and rewrites the manual-install and verification commands so the path resolves to the single-level location where the skill actually lands. OpenCode session-catchup note updated to point at the SQLite store path the v2.38.0 rewrite introduced, replacing the stale "Full ... support is planned for a future release" line.

- **`.continue` variant SKILL.md sync gap from v2.34.0 to v2.43.0** (Issue #159): nine versions behind canonical. v2.43.0 ports Rule 7 (Continue After Completion), the Security Boundary section with delimiter framing and hash attestation, the expanded Scripts section listing `init-session.sh`/`set-active-plan.sh`/`resolve-plan-dir.sh`/`check-complete.sh`/`session-catchup.py`/`attest-plan.sh` plus the parallel task workflow block, the "Write web content to task_plan.md" Anti-Pattern row, and the 5-Question Reboot Test. Continue-specific items preserved: `.continue/skills/...` script paths, session-catchup invocation shape. The v2.34.0 Security Boundary table removed (canonical version supersedes it with delimiter/attestation coverage). File grew from 92 to 179 lines.

- **`.gemini` variant SKILL.md sync gap from v2.34.0 to v2.43.0** (Issue #160): nine versions behind canonical. v2.43.0 ports the same canonical content as `.continue` plus the parallel task workflow and 5-Question Reboot Test. Gemini-specific items preserved: `hooks: "Configured in .gemini/settings.json (SessionStart, BeforeTool, AfterTool, BeforeModel)"` metadata key. The Claude-specific Turn-Loop Integration section is omitted because Gemini CLI has no `/plan-goal`, `/plan-loop`, or `PreCompact` hook primitive; the Gemini-specific Security Boundary section references Gemini lifecycle hooks instead. File grew from 179 to 199 lines.

- **`.kiro` variant SKILL.md sync gap from v2.32.0-kiro to v2.43.0-kiro** (Issue #161): eleven versions behind canonical. v2.43.0 ports Rule 7, the expanded Scripts section (bootstrap, session-catchup, check-complete), the Anti-Patterns table, and the 5-Question Reboot Test. Kiro-specific items preserved: `metadata.integration: kiro` field, Agent Skill layout, `compatibility:` frontmatter key, STEP 0/1/2/3 structure, `.kiro/steering/` references, `#[[file:.kiro/plan/…]]` live references, and `assets/scripts/` path convention. Version kept as `2.43.0-kiro` per the original suffix convention.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.43.0 across 17 parity-locked files via `scripts/bump-version.py`. The three lagging variants (`.continue`, `.gemini`, `.kiro`) were synced manually in this release; `.pi` remains intentionally on the npm scheme (`1.1.0` in `package.json`) per AGENTS.md.

### Verification

- Test count: 130 pass, 2 skip (Windows exec-bit, pre-existing baseline since v2.34.1), 0 fail. PR #171 adds markdown only; the v2.43.0 fix for `docs/opencode.md` touches no executable paths; `.continue`, `.gemini`, and `.kiro` SKILL.md rewrites are read by the model at runtime, not parsed by the test suite. The parity test (`test_skill_md_version_parity.py`) continues to validate the 17-file parity set without drift.

### Thanks

- @Skulli485 for the CONTRIBUTING.md draft (PR #171), first contribution to the repo.
- @luyanfeng for reporting the OpenCode docs path bug (issue #172), first contribution to the repo.

## [2.42.0] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- **POSIX `init-session.sh` portability across the 8 mirrors** (PR #169 by @carterusedulm2-maker): the script's shebang is `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, but `tests/test_init_session_slug.py:27` invokes it via `["sh", str(INIT_SH), *args]` which bypasses the shebang and runs the body under whatever `sh` resolves to. On Ubuntu and Debian where `/bin/sh` is `dash`, the `while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]` bashism failed with a syntax error before any slug-mode argument parsing could run. v2.42.0 swaps to POSIX `while [ $# -gt 0 ]` in the 8 mirrored copies: `scripts/init-session.sh` (top level), `skills/planning-with-files/scripts/init-session.sh` (canonical), and the `.codebuddy`, `.codex`, `.continue`, `.factory`, `.gemini`, `.pi` adapter copies. Behavior is identical under bash; the change only restores compatibility under dash so the slug-mode test suite runs portably.

### Added

- **Install-scope transparency block in canonical `SKILL.md`** (Turn-Loop Integration section). Documents which install route ships which surface: `/plugin install` includes the `commands/` folder with `/plan-goal` and `/plan-loop`, but `npx skills add` (and ClawHub) install only the contents of `skills/planning-with-files/` and therefore do not register the wrapper slash commands. The `PreCompact` hook is registered in the SKILL.md frontmatter and works for both routes. Also notes the `disable-model-invocation: true` interaction tracked in upstream issues anthropics/claude-code #26251 and #41417, where some Claude Code sessions refuse to execute the slash command even when the user types it directly.
- **Manual fallback procedure** for `/plan-goal` and `/plan-loop` inline in the canonical `SKILL.md`. The procedures mirror what the `commands/plan-goal.md` and `commands/plan-loop.md` files would have fed the model when invoked: resolve the active plan, compose the goal condition or loop tick prompt, then issue Claude Code's native `/goal` or `/loop` primitive (always available, not plugin-scoped). Lets skill-only installs and sessions affected by the disable-model-invocation refusal pattern produce the same effect by following the steps inline.

### Docs

- **Topic Handoff Pattern documentation in `docs/quickstart.md` and `docs/workflow.md`** (PR #170 by @carterusedulm2-maker): documents an optional convention for splitting unrelated topics across `.planning/<slug>/` directories or a manual `handoffs/<topic>.md` detail layer alongside `progress.md`. The pattern is documentation-only; no shipped script reads `handoffs/`. Recommended for long-running operational topics that span multiple sessions, where keeping `progress.md` concise as a timeline index and putting durable detail (current state, commands, validation, risks, rollback, PR links) in a per-topic handoff file is easier to navigate after a `/clear`.
- **README releases table row for v2.42.0** plus version badge bumped to 2.42.0.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.42.0 across 17 parity-locked files (14 SKILL.md variants plus `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, `CITATION.cff`) via `scripts/bump-version.py`. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, `.kiro` lag intentionally per AGENTS.md release scope.

### Verification

- Test count: 130 pass, 2 skip (Windows exec-bit, pre-existing baseline since v2.34.1), 0 fail. PR #169 changes shell-only string syntax across mirrored scripts; PR #170 adds markdown only. Neither touches hooks, attestation, the resolver, or any script-execution path. Security audit completed 2026-05-25 (see `.planning/2026-05-25-security-audit/findings.md`): semgrep 0 findings, no preinstall/postinstall hooks anywhere, no remote fetches, SLUG_RE path-traversal defense parity confirmed across the 14 SKILL.md variants.
- Web research basis for the transparency block: Anthropic skill docs at `code.claude.com/docs/en/skills` confirm that prompt-based slash commands are the blessed Claude Code pattern (matches bundled skills like `/loop`, `/goal`, `/run`, `/verify`, `/debug`). Quote: "Unlike most built-in commands, which execute fixed logic directly, bundled skills are prompt-based: they give Claude detailed instructions and let it orchestrate the work using its tools." The `commands/` and `skills/` directories are now unified per Anthropic: "Custom commands have been merged into skills." Plugin scope still distinguishes installation surface from `npx skills add`.

### Thanks

- @carterusedulm2-maker for both the POSIX init-session compatibility fix (PR #169) and the Topic Handoff workflow documentation (PR #170). Both filed on 2026-05-25, first contributions to the repo.

## [2.41.0] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- **Windows POSIX exec-bit tests now skip on NTFS** (PR #167 by @gauravvojha, Issue #166): `test_script_permissions.py` relied on POSIX executable bits which NTFS does not preserve. The two tests in the `CanonicalScriptPermissionsTests` class (`test_shell_scripts_are_executable`, `test_session_catchup_is_executable`) ran fine on Linux and macOS but always failed on Windows with `mode: 0o100666`. v2.41.0 adds a class-level `@pytest.mark.skipif(sys.platform == "win32")` decorator so the tests skip cleanly on Windows while still running on POSIX file systems. The upstream PR patch introduced a malformed duplicate standalone function at module scope and a nested method inside it; the fix was corrected to class-level granularity during merge.
- **Post-merge test-file repair** (follow-up to PR #167): the squash-merged patch from PR #167 left `tests/test_script_permissions.py` in a broken state at `ed43a71`. The standalone-function duplicate and nested class method were removed, imports re-sorted, and the class-level `pytest.mark.skipif` re-applied correctly. No test logic changed.

### Added

- **`docs/attestation-locking.md`**: new documentation page covering the `scripts/attest-plan.sh` write path, the atomic temp-rename correctness guarantee, the optional `flock` advisory lock, a platform behavior table (Linux, macOS, Windows Git Bash, WSL), and the recommended slug-mode workflow for parallel sessions. Linked from the canonical `SKILL.md` Security Boundary section for discoverability. (PR #168 by @CleanDev-Fix, Issue #165)

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.41.0 across 17 parity-locked files (14 SKILL.md variants plus `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, `CITATION.cff`) via `scripts/bump-version.py`. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, `.kiro` lag intentionally per AGENTS.md release scope.

### Verification

- Test count: 130 pass, 2 skip (Windows exec-bit tests), 0 fail. PR #167 touches only `tests/test_script_permissions.py`; PR #168 adds `docs/attestation-locking.md` plus a two-line SKILL.md link. Neither PR touches hook bodies, canonical scripts, or the attestation mechanism.

### Thanks

- @gauravvojha for reporting the Windows exec-bit failure in Issue #166 and supplying the first-pass fix in PR #167.
- @CleanDev-Fix (CleanFix-Dev) for the attestation-locking documentation in PR #168, which closes Issue #165.

## [2.40.1] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- **Pi adapter SKILL.md sync gap** (PR #158 by @TomXPRIME): the `.pi/skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md` variant lagged the canonical Claude Code copy after v2.39.0 shipped. Four pieces of surface were missing on Pi: Rule 7 (Continue After Completion) covering multi-cycle plan extension when the user requests additional work, the Security Boundary section documenting the BEGIN/END delimiter framing plus the v2.37 hash attestation defense layers, the expanded Scripts section covering `set-active-plan.sh`, `resolve-plan-dir.sh`, `attest-plan.sh`, and the parallel task workflow, and the "Write web content to task_plan.md" anti-pattern row. v2.40.1 backports all four items so Pi users get the same instruction surface as Claude Code users. The redundant manual session-catchup instruction in the Pi SKILL.md is removed because the Pi extension shipped in v2.39.0 handles that lifecycle event automatically.
- **Pi npm package scope correction** (PR #158): `.pi/skills/planning-with-files/package.json` `name` field was set to the unscoped `pi-planning-with-files`. Tom owns the npm publishing chain for the Pi package; the unscoped form had ownership ambiguity. v2.40.1 renames to `@tomxprime/planning-with-files`, matching the package author's npm namespace. Author "Ahmad Othman Ammar Adi", repository URL, license, and bugs URL are preserved. No new dependencies, no preinstall or postinstall scripts, no new bin entries, no new files; only the `name` field changed.
- **Pi install docs updated** (PR #158): `.pi/skills/planning-with-files/README.md` install command updated to `pi install npm:@tomxprime/planning-with-files`. The manual install section is rewritten to use `pi install ./.pi/skills/planning-with-files` (local path) or a `.pi/settings.json` `packages` entry, replacing the previous "copy the folder into your skills dir then `/reload`" prose. SKILL.md cross-references updated to match.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.40.1 across the 14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `CITATION.cff` via `scripts/bump-version.py`. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, `.kiro` lag intentionally per CLAUDE.md release scope.

### Verification

- Test count: 130 pass / 2 pre-existing Windows exec-bit failures (test_script_permissions, unchanged from v2.40.0 and unrelated to this release). PR #158 changes the Pi adapter doc surface and `package.json` `name`; the Pi extension TypeScript runtime, hook bodies, and canonical Claude Code surface are not touched. Safety audit on the PR confirmed no supply-chain attack vectors: no new dependencies, no install hooks, no bin shims, no new files, author and repository metadata preserved.

### Thanks

- @TomXPRIME: second contribution after the Pi full hook parity extension in v2.39.0. The Pi adapter is now actively maintained by its author, with the npm publishing chain pointing at his scoped namespace and the SKILL.md surface kept in sync with the canonical Claude Code copy.

## [2.40.0] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- **Hook resolution order inverted: slug-mode now wins over legacy root** (item #1 in `proposal_v2_40.md`). Before v2.40, every hook body in `SKILL.md` checked `if [ -f task_plan.md ]` at the project root FIRST and only consulted `.planning/.active_plan` for attestation lookup, never for content lookup. When both a root `task_plan.md` and a slug-mode plan existed, the root plan silently won and the user's explicitly-active slug plan was bypassed. v2.40 rewrites the resolution chain across `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, and `PreCompact` so they consult `$PLAN_ID` env, then `.planning/.active_plan`, then newest `.planning/<slug>/` by mtime, and only fall back to root `task_plan.md` if no slug-mode plan resolves. Legacy single-file users keep working; parallel-plan users get the plan they actually pinned.
- **`.active_plan` target dir validated before use** (item #2). If `.active_plan` content points to a deleted plan dir, the hook used to silently no-op because the outer `if [ -f task_plan.md ]` only checked root. v2.40 falls through to the newest-mtime resolution path, then root, instead of leaving the model with no context.
- **`.active_plan` content validated against a safe-identifier regex** (item #3). `tr -d '[:space:]'` normalized whitespace-only content to an empty string, which the hook then concatenated into `.planning//task_plan.md` (an empty plan id). v2.40 enforces `^[A-Za-z0-9_][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$` on both `$PLAN_ID` env and `.active_plan` content, so corruption (whitespace, path traversal like `../escape`, leading-dot dotfile names) falls through to the next resolution step instead of producing weird path lookups.
- **`check-complete.sh` honors `$PLAN_ID` and `.active_plan`** (item #4). The Stop hook passed `.planning/$AP/task_plan.md` explicitly so the bug was silent there, but any user invocation or third-party tooling that called `check-complete.sh` with no args saw "No task_plan.md found" even with an active slug plan. v2.40 wires the script into `resolve-plan-dir.sh` when no explicit path argument is passed, restoring slug-mode parity. Behavior with an explicit path argument is unchanged.
- **Pi extension dangerous-command list uses word-boundary regex** (item #5). `runtime.ts` `isDangerousBashCommand` used substring matching against a flat list including `"git push"`. Every benign `git push origin <branch>` fired the warning, training users to ignore it. v2.40 replaces the substring list with a `DANGEROUS_BASH_PATTERNS` regex array: `\brm\s+-[a-z]*r[a-z]*f\b`, `\bsudo\b`, `\bchmod\s+(0?777|a\+rwx)\b`, `\bgit\s+push\s+.*(--force|-f\b|--mirror|\+)`, `\bgit\s+reset\s+--hard\b`, `\bgit\s+clean\s+-[a-z]*[fdx]`, a shell fork-bomb pattern, and `\bdd\s+.*of=/dev/[sh]d[a-z]`. Benign `git push` no longer triggers the notify; only destructive variants do.

### Performance

- **mtime-keyed SHA-256 cache in attestation hook** (item #6). Each `UserPromptSubmit` and `PreToolUse` hook previously ran a fresh `sha256sum` on `task_plan.md` to compare against the stored attestation. On Windows Git Bash this is ~800ms per fire dominated by bash spawn and disk I/O; over a 60-event session that is ~48 seconds of cumulative latency. v2.40 caches the result under `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/pwf-sha/<key>` keyed by the absolute plan-file path, storing `mtime` and the hash. On the next fire, if the plan file's mtime is unchanged, the cached hash is reused without re-running `sha256sum`. The cache is per-system, transient, and invalidated automatically by any plan edit.
- **KV-cache hygiene on injected progress.md tail** (item #7). The Manus-aligned auto-injection feature is most valuable when the Claude / Sonnet / Opus prefix cache stays warm across turns. The previous injection embedded the literal `tail -20 progress.md`, including sub-second timestamps and timezone-suffix forms that change every fire. Those bytes mid-prefix prevented cache reuse. v2.40 pipes the tail through `sed -E` to normalize `T<HH:MM:SS>(.<frac>)?Z` and `T<HH:MM:SS>(.<frac>)?(+|-)HH:MM` to a stable `T00:00:00Z` / `T00:00:00<TZ>` form before injection. The model still sees recent progress structure; only the volatile sub-fields are collapsed.

### Portability

- **`resolve-plan-dir.sh` uses portable mtime fallback chain** (item #19). The old `date -r FILE +%s || stat -c '%Y' FILE || echo 0` chain silently fell to `0` on systems lacking GNU coreutils (some Windows Git Bash builds, alpine busybox, restricted CI containers). When mtime resolves to `0` for every dir in `.planning/*/`, the newest-by-mtime resolution becomes order-dependent on directory listing rather than actual recency. v2.40 extends the chain to: GNU `stat -c '%Y'`, BSD `stat -f '%m'`, `date -r FILE +%s`, `python3 -c ... os.stat`, `python -c ... os.stat`, `perl -e ... (stat $f)[9]`, then `0`. The earlier paths cover GNU + BSD + macOS + Windows Git Bash + Alpine + WSL; the python/perl fallbacks cover everything else with a runtime cost only paid when the native shell tools are absent.
- **`attest-plan.sh` uses atomic temp-rename with optional `flock` guard** (item #20). Concurrent legacy-mode attestations (two sessions in the same cwd with no `PLAN_ID`) used to race on a non-atomic `> .plan-attestation` redirect, occasionally producing a truncated or zero-length attestation that the hook then read as the expected hash and threw a false `[PLAN TAMPERED]` on the next prompt. v2.40 writes to a `.plan-attestation.tmp.<pid>` and renames into place, with `flock -w 5` around the rename when `flock` is available. The atomic-rename guarantee is the real fix; the flock is the cooperative gate against multi-writer disk-stall edge cases. The script also surfaces a one-line note when legacy-mode attestation activity is detected within 30 seconds of a prior write, pointing users to slug-mode for parallel sessions.

### Verification

- Test count: 130 pass / 2 pre-existing Windows exec-bit failures (test_script_permissions, unchanged from v2.39.0 and unrelated to this release). +20 new tests vs v2.39.0: 5 in `tests/test_resolve_plan_dir.py` covering corruption + dead-target + invalid-slug-scan, 5 in `tests/test_check_complete_resolver.py` covering the resolver wire-up, 1 concurrent-writer test in `tests/test_plan_attestation.py`, 1 word-boundary contract test in `tests/test_pi_extension_capabilities.py`, 8 hook-body behavioral tests in `tests/test_hook_body_v240.py` covering slug-beats-root, legacy-root, silent no-plan, corrupt-active-plan fall-through, SHA cache population, tamper-still-blocks, progress-timestamp normalization, and PreToolUse injection.
- Hook body now ~3.2 KB single-line bash per event (up from ~1 KB in v2.39.0). Same idiom as the existing inline pattern. Long-term extract to `scripts/inject-plan-context.sh` is tracked as v2.41-class work in `proposal_v2_40.md`.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.40.0 across 14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, `CITATION.cff` via `scripts/bump-version.py`. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, `.kiro` lag intentionally.

### Not changed (deliberate)

- No brainstorm-before-plan gate (item #8 in `proposal_v2_40.md`). Deferred to a later release because it changes user-facing workflow shape and deserves its own focused cycle.
- No new sidecar files (`decisions.md`, `lessons.md`, `await_approval.md`, dispatch queue, checkpoints). All deferred to v2.41 or v3.0 per the proposal.
- No refactor of the canonical hook body into a dedicated script (item #17). The inline pattern is preserved; the new logic ships within the same single-line idiom. This is acknowledged as maintenance debt and tracked for v2.41.

## [2.39.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Pi Coding Agent full hook parity extension** (PR #157 by @TomXPRIME): the `.pi/skills/planning-with-files/` adapter previously shipped only the markdown skill, with a docs note that hook-style automation was Claude Code specific and not available on Pi. v2.39.0 ships a bundled TypeScript extension under `.pi/skills/planning-with-files/extensions/planning-with-files/` that maps Pi lifecycle events onto the same behavior the skill provides on Claude Code. Event surface: `session_start` runs session catchup, `before_agent_start` injects plan context, `tool_call` adds pre-tool recitation, `tool_result` appends the post-write reminder to write/edit outputs, `agent_end` auto-continues incomplete plans (limit 3 per session+plan), `session_before_compact` flushes the plan reminder with the active `Plan-SHA256`, `session_shutdown` clears loop timers and per-session state, `input` resets the auto-continue counter on user activity. The extension declares itself via `pi.extensions` in `.pi/skills/planning-with-files/package.json` so `pi install npm:pi-planning-with-files` auto-loads it.
- **Pi mode system** (PR #157): four modes select how the extension talks to the model. `auto` (default) reads the active model's provider plus id, picks `cache-safe` when DeepSeek is detected, picks `parity` otherwise. `parity` reproduces the full Claude-style dynamic injection (plan content varies per fire). `cache-safe` swaps the dynamic content for fixed reminder strings so the DeepSeek KV-cache prefix stays stable across turns. `notify` surfaces the reminder via `ctx.ui.notify` only, never adds tokens to the model input. Configurable via `PWF_MODE` env var, project `.pi/settings.json`, or global `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` under the `planningWithFiles.mode` key.
- **Pi attestation gate** (PR #157): the Pi extension reads the same `.planning/<active-plan>/.attestation` file the canonical v2.37 `attest-plan.sh` writes. On every hook fire it recomputes the SHA-256 of `task_plan.md` and compares against the stored hash. On mismatch the extension blocks injection and emits the `[PLAN TAMPERED]` warning with the expected and actual hashes plus the path to re-approve. Source of truth is shared with Claude Code, so attesting once locks the plan across both runtimes.
- **Pi slash commands** (PR #157): four commands registered through `pi.registerCommand` mirror their Claude Code counterparts. `/plan-status` prints active plan path, scope, phase totals. `/plan-attest [--show|--clear]` runs the canonical attest helper (`.ps1` on Windows, `.sh` on POSIX), surfacing the result through `ctx.ui.notify`. `/plan-goal <text|default|clear>` sets a termination criterion that the auto-continue path appends to its prompt; `default` resolves to the canonical "all phases complete" condition. `/plan-loop [interval] [prompt|stop]` sets up a `setInterval` tick that re-reads the plan and nudges progress, with `stop` and `session_shutdown` both clearing the timer.
- **`.pi/skills/planning-with-files/package.json`**: declares the new `pi.extensions` array, adds `peerDependencies` for `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, bumps the npm scheme to `1.1.0` to reflect the extension surface addition (npm scheme remains independent of the canonical 2.x version).
- **`docs/cache-safe-diagram.md`**: ASCII diagram showing how cache-safe mode keeps the KV-cache prefix stable across turns for DeepSeek and other prefix-sensitive models.
- **`tests/test_pi_extension_packaging.py`** (3 tests): asserts the `.pi` package.json declares `pi.extensions`, the extension entrypoint exists, and the extension directory carries all required source files.
- **`tests/test_pi_extension_capabilities.py`** (5 tests): asserts the runtime registers the four documented commands, declares all eight expected event handlers, and exposes the documented mode enum.
- **`tests/test_pi_docs_hook_support.py`** (4 tests): asserts the Pi docs no longer carry the "hooks are Claude Code specific" disclaimer, the SKILL.md surface lists the new commands, and the README documents the mode system.

### Fixed

- **Codex `[features]` flag name** (Issue #154 by @DLI1996): `docs/codex.md` instructed users to add `codex_hooks = true` under `[features]` in `~/.codex/config.toml`. OpenAI updated the canonical Codex hooks docs (developers.openai.com/codex/hooks) to make `hooks` the canonical key and `codex_hooks` a deprecated alias. v2.39.0 swaps the docs to `hooks = true` in four sites (introductory callout, the "Enable Hooks in config.toml" code block plus its follow-up prose, and the troubleshooting checklist), and adds a one-line note in each spot that `codex_hooks = true` still works as a deprecated alias so users on older configs are not pushed to migrate. Verification command updated to `rg '^(hooks|codex_hooks)\s'`.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.39.0 across 14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `CITATION.cff` via `scripts/bump-version.py`. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, `.kiro` lag intentionally; `.pi` carries its own npm scheme bump (1.0.1 to 1.1.0) inside `.pi/skills/planning-with-files/package.json` for the extension surface addition.

### Verification scope

- Python contract tests (110 pass, 2 pre-existing Windows exec-bit fails unrelated to this release) cover the Pi extension's packaging, declared event surface, declared command surface, and documentation. The TypeScript runtime itself runs only when loaded by a live Pi Coding Agent process. Behavior under Pi was validated by the PR author; no CI runtime test exists for the Pi extension code path. Pi-specific regressions should be filed as new issues against `.pi/skills/planning-with-files/extensions/`.

### Thanks

- @TomXPRIME for the Pi full hook parity extension (PR #157). Lifecycle event mappings, mode system, attestation gate, four slash commands, and 12 contract tests, iterated through PRs #155 and #156 to land code-only in #157.
- @DLI1996 for catching the Codex `[features]` flag drift against OpenAI's canonical docs (Issue #154).

## [2.38.1] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- **Description field garbled in Claude Code skill picker** (surfaced by @bmyury via Discussion #153): the canonical SKILL.md frontmatter declares hooks inline as YAML scalars. Several of those scalars contain `'---BEGIN PLAN DATA---'` and `'---END PLAN DATA---'` as plan-injection delimiters (introduced in v2.36.1, reinforced in v2.37 attestation). Frontmatter parsers that split on the literal string `---` to locate the closing fence read the first `---` inside a hook command as the fence, truncating the YAML mid-string. Claude Code's skill-discovery loader behaves this way, so the description shown in the in-product skill list was a fragment of the hook command tail (`BEGIN PLAN DATA---'; head -50 task_plan.md...`) instead of the documented description. Real YAML parsers handled the frontmatter correctly, so hook execution and tamper attestation were never affected; only the displayed metadata was wrong. v2.38.1 swaps the delimiter shape from `---BEGIN PLAN DATA---` / `---END PLAN DATA---` to `===BEGIN PLAN DATA===` / `===END PLAN DATA===` across the canonical SKILL.md, all five language variants, the `.codebuddy`, `.codex`, `.cursor` adapter mirrors, and the `clawhub-upload` bundle. Same delimiter shape, same model-side framing semantics; the `===` substring does not collide with YAML's document separator.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.38.1 across 14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `CITATION.cff` via `scripts/bump-version.py`. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, `.kiro` lag intentionally.
- Pre-existing line-ending drift in IDE adapter mirrors (`examples.md`, `attest-plan.sh`, `attest-plan.ps1` under `.codex`, `.cursor`, `.gemini`, `.opencode`, `.pi`) normalized to LF via `scripts/sync-ide-folders.py`. 12 files touched, content identical to canonical.

### Thanks

- @bmyury for surfacing the description display bug via Discussion #153.

## [2.38.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- **PreCompact hook**: a new hook event fires on Claude Code's autoCompact and manual `/compact`. When `task_plan.md` is present, the hook surfaces a reminder to flush in-context progress to `progress.md` before compaction completes, and prints the active `Plan-SHA256` if an attestation is set. Added to the canonical SKILL.md plus all five language variants plus `clawhub-upload`. Other IDE mirrors fall back to their pre-existing compaction-related hooks (Codex `/compact` callback, OpenCode `session.compacted`, Hermes `pre_llm_call`) until per-IDE PreCompact adapters land in a later release.
- **`/plan-goal` slash command**: composes with Claude Code's new `/goal` primitive (v2.1.139, May 12 2026). Derives a goal condition from the active plan (`all phases in task_plan.md report Status: complete`) and forwards it to `/goal` so the agent keeps working until the plan-file is genuinely done, not just when the conversation looks done. Plan-loop and plan-goal are intentionally composable: cadence + termination criterion.
- **`/plan-loop` slash command**: composes with Claude Code's `/loop` primitive (v2.1.72+). Default 10-minute tick re-reads the planning files, runs `check-complete`, and nudges an entry into `progress.md` if nothing has changed since the last tick. Override interval and prompt as you would with bare `/loop`.
- **`templates/loop.md`**: a planning-aware default prompt users can copy into `.claude/loop.md` (project) or `~/.claude/loop.md` (user) so bare `/loop` runs grounded in the active plan. `/loop` only reads these two paths; copy is required, not auto-wired.
- **OpenCode SQLite session catchup**: the skill's session-catchup script reads OpenCode's new SQLite store at `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/opencode/opencode.db` (sst/opencode dev @ 2026-05-14, schema: `session(id, directory, time_created, ...)` + `part(id, session_id, time_created, data TEXT JSON)`). The previous JSON-tree reader silently no-op'd for every OpenCode user since the storage migration. Now opens the DB read-only via URI (`file:<path>?mode=ro`), scopes by `session.directory`, and surfaces the most recent unsynced planning-file edits with the same UX as the Claude Code path. Defensive `PRAGMA table_info` probe degrades cleanly on schema migrations. Verified end-to-end against a real 162 MB OpenCode database on the development machine (94 sessions, correctly extracted 56 unsynced parts from a session with planning-file edits).
- **Codex `PermissionRequest` adapter**: Codex added a `PermissionRequest` hook event for tool-permission prompts. The new `.codex/hooks/permission_request.py` adapter surfaces a one-line reminder to review `task_plan.md` before approving a request, when an active plan is present. Session-attachment gated (legacy default-on, isolation opt-in). Read-only; never blocks the request.
- **SKILL.md body documentation**: a new "Claude Code Turn-Loop Integration (v2.38.0+)" section documents the PreCompact hook, `/plan-goal`, `/plan-loop`, and the `loop.md` template install. Surfaces v2.38 features in user-facing prose, not only frontmatter.
- **`clawhub-upload/` full sync**: the ClawHub upload bundle had drifted from canonical somewhere around v2.32 (missing slug-mode, set-active-plan, resolve-plan-dir, attest-plan scripts, BEGIN/END injection delimiters, hash attestation hook bodies). Re-synced from canonical so the manual ClawHub upload reflects current v2.38 state.
- **`tests/test_precompact_hook.py`** (6 tests): asserts the PreCompact hook is declared with a wildcard matcher, stays silent without `task_plan.md`, emits the reminder when the plan exists, surfaces `Plan-SHA256` only when an attestation file is set, and exits 0 on every code path.
- **`tests/test_v238_command_files.py`** (7 tests): asserts `commands/plan-goal.md`, `commands/plan-loop.md`, and `templates/loop.md` exist, carry the expected frontmatter, document the `/goal` 4000-char limit, and reference all three planning files.
- **`tests/test_session_catchup_opencode.py`** (4 tests): builds a synthetic `opencode.db` matching the live schema, asserts the catchup function finds the most recent planning-file edit, stays silent when no plan edit is present, and degrades silently when the DB is missing.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.38.0 across 14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `CITATION.cff` via `scripts/bump-version.py`. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, `.kiro` lag intentionally.
- Canonical session-catchup script propagated to `.codebuddy`, `.codex`, `.continue`, `.factory`, `.gemini`, `.opencode`, `.pi` via `scripts/sync-ide-folders.py`.

### Not changed (deliberate)

- **No `paths` glob restriction in the canonical SKILL.md frontmatter.** The Claude Code spec now supports a `paths` field that filters auto-invocation to matching file types. Adding it would silently change auto-invocation behavior for the existing install base. Deferred to a later release with explicit signal data.
- **No bulk replacement of inline hook bodies with `!command` substitution.** That substitution runs at skill-load time, not per hook fire. Wholesale swap would freeze the SHA-256 attestation hash at load time and silently disable v2.37's tamper-detection gate. Inline hook bodies retained for per-fire runtime checks.
- **No native Plan Mode panel integration.** Claude Code's April 14 2026 desktop redesign added a Plan Mode panel with Approve/Reject flow, but no plugin/skill API is publicly documented for rendering plans into that panel. Tracked for a future release.
- **No language variant consolidation.** Issue #130 (consolidate into a single skill with locale parameter) is a separate breaking change and is not bundled into this release. The five locale-specific variants continue to ship.

## [2.37.0] - 2026-05-05

### Security

- **Hash attestation for plan injection** (Issue #150 by @oaabahussain): `task_plan.md` content is auto-injected into the model context on every UserPromptSubmit and PreToolUse fire. v2.36.1 added BEGIN/END delimiters, but the model still parses the bytes. v2.37.0 adds an opt-in second layer: run `/plan-attest` (or `sh scripts/attest-plan.sh`) once a plan is finalised. The script computes a SHA-256 of `task_plan.md` and stores it at `.planning/<active-plan>/.attestation` (parallel-plan mode) or `./.plan-attestation` (legacy mode). On every hook fire, the inline check recomputes the hash and compares. On mismatch, injection is blocked and the model receives `[planning-with-files] [PLAN TAMPERED — injection blocked]` instead of plan content. When attestation is set, the injected context also carries a `Plan-SHA256:` line so the model can log the attested hash for audit. Opt-in: absence of an attestation file preserves the v2.36.x behavior.

### Added

- **`/plan-attest` slash command**: thin wrapper around `attest-plan.sh` with `--show` (print the stored hash) and `--clear` (re-open the plan to free editing).
- **`scripts/attest-plan.sh` and `scripts/attest-plan.ps1`**: SHA-256 attestation helper for both POSIX shell and Windows PowerShell. Resolves the active plan via the same `$PLAN_ID` / `.active_plan` / newest-mtime / legacy chain used by the rest of the skill.
- **`scripts/bump-version.py`** (Issue #151 by @oaabahussain): atomic version bumper for the parity-locked file set (14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, `CITATION.cff`). Replaces 17 hand edits with one `python scripts/bump-version.py X.Y.Z`. Prevents the "missed one variant" regression class that hit v2.34.1, v2.36.0, v2.36.2, and v2.36.3. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, and `.kiro` are intentionally excluded (separate version schemes); the script lists them at the end of every run so the omission stays visible.
- **`tests/test_skill_md_version_parity.py`** (Issue #151): four assertions that fail the build the moment any parity-locked file diverges from the canonical SKILL.md version. Catches drift in CI before it can ship.
- **`tests/test_plan_attestation.py`**: six tests covering legacy and parallel-plan attestation, `--show`, `--clear`, tamper detection, and missing-plan handling.

### Fixed

- **Duplicate test class in `tests/test_canonical_script_sync.py`**: a leftover second copy of `CanonicalScriptSyncTests` (lines 99 to 137) was running the same assertions twice. Removed.

### Changed

- **Security Boundary section in canonical SKILL.md**: now documents the two layers of defense (delimiters + attestation) and adds an explicit rule recommending `/plan-attest` after finalising a plan.
- **`scripts/sync-ide-folders.py`**: SCRIPTS manifest now includes `attest-plan.sh` and `attest-plan.ps1`. The eight pre-existing scripts are unchanged.
- **`tests/test_canonical_script_sync.py`**: `SHARED_SCRIPTS` extended to ten entries (added `attest-plan.sh` and `attest-plan.ps1`). The regression test now covers all user-facing scripts.
- Version bumped to 2.37.0 across 14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `CITATION.cff` via `scripts/bump-version.py`.

### Thanks

- @oaabahussain for two thoughtful, well-scoped P1 reports: Issue #150 turned the v2.36.1 delimiter mitigation into a verifiable cryptographic guarantee, and Issue #151 named the regression class behind four consecutive releases and proposed the right surgical fix.

## [2.36.3] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- **Missing parallel planning scripts in canonical skill copy**: `resolve-plan-dir.sh`, `resolve-plan-dir.ps1`, `set-active-plan.sh`, and `set-active-plan.ps1` were added to `scripts/` in v2.36.0 but never propagated to `skills/planning-with-files/scripts/` or the IDE mirror folders. Users installing via `npx skills add` could not use the v2.36.0 parallel planning workflow because the key scripts were not shipped in the install. Same class of gap as PR #149.
- **`sync-ide-folders.py` manifest incomplete**: the sync manifest only listed the original five scripts and did not include the four new v2.36.0 scripts. Running the sync tool after this release propagates all nine user-facing scripts to all IDE mirrors.
- **`test_canonical_script_sync.py` did not cover new scripts**: the SHARED_SCRIPTS tuple in the regression test from PR #149 only listed the original four scripts. Updated to include all eight user-facing scripts that must stay in sync between `scripts/` and `skills/planning-with-files/scripts/`.

### Added

- **Parallel planning documentation in SKILL.md**: the Scripts section now documents `resolve-plan-dir.sh` and `set-active-plan.sh` with usage descriptions and a parallel task workflow example showing how to use slug mode, `set-active-plan.sh`, and `export PLAN_ID` together.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.36.3 across 14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `CITATION.cff`

## [2.36.2] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- **Canonical skill copy missing slug-mode init-session** (PR #149 by @voidborne-d): `skills/planning-with-files/scripts/init-session.sh` and `init-session.ps1` were not updated when slug mode shipped in v2.36.0. Users installing via `npx skills add` or any of the nine IDE folders received the legacy-only v2.0.0 script, silently missing the parallel plan isolation feature. Fixed by syncing the top-level canonical scripts into the skill directory and all IDE mirrors.
- **Shebang drift in IDE mirror scripts**: `check-complete.sh` in `.codebuddy/`, `.codex/`, `.continue/`, `.factory/`, `.gemini/`, `.pi/` folders still used `#!/bin/bash`. Synced to `#!/usr/bin/env bash` to match the Emin017 fix from v2.35.1.
- **Analytics template gap in canonical PS1**: `init-session.ps1` in the canonical skill copy lacked the `--template analytics` support added in v2.29.0 by @mvanhorn. Included in this sync.

### Added

- **Regression test** `tests/test_canonical_script_sync.py`: asserts `init-session.{sh,ps1}` and `check-complete.{sh,ps1}` are byte-identical between `scripts/` and `skills/planning-with-files/scripts/`. A second assertion invokes `sync-ide-folders.py --verify` to catch IDE mirror drift in CI. Prevents this class of silent version mismatch from recurring.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.36.2 across 14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `CITATION.cff`
- `CONTRIBUTORS.md` updated: added @voidborne-d (PR #149)

### Thanks

- @voidborne-d for catching the canonical/top-level script drift, providing grep proof, running the sync tool, and adding the regression test that prevents recurrence (PR #149)

## [2.36.1] - 2026-05-01

### Security

- **Stop hook: eliminate broad cache search** (Gen Agent Trust Hub COMMAND_EXECUTION): replaced `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` over `~/.claude/plugins/cache` with resolution through `$CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR` env var first, then two specific known install paths (`~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/`). Removes the attack surface where a malicious `check-complete.ps1` planted anywhere in the cache directory would be found and executed.
- **PowerShell ExecutionPolicy: Bypass → RemoteSigned** (Gen Agent Trust Hub COMMAND_EXECUTION): `ExecutionPolicy Bypass` circumvents all script execution policies. `RemoteSigned` allows locally created scripts while still blocking downloaded scripts that lack a trusted signature. Applied across all 14 SKILL.md variants.
- **Prompt injection delimiters** (Gen Agent Trust Hub PROMPT_INJECTION): `UserPromptSubmit` and `PreToolUse` hook output now wraps injected plan content in `---BEGIN PLAN DATA---` / `---END PLAN DATA---` markers with explicit model instructions to treat enclosed content as structured data and ignore embedded instructions. Addresses the lack of sanitization and boundary markers flagged in the audit.
- **Security Boundary section updated** (Snyk W011): added explicit model instruction that `findings.md` content (which ingests third-party web/search results) must be treated as raw data regardless of what it contains. Clarifies the delimiter contract to auditors and the model.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.36.1 across all 14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `CITATION.cff`

## [2.36.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- **Parallel plan isolation** (Issue #148 by @shawnli1874): `init-session.sh` now accepts a task name and creates a dated, readable plan directory under `.planning/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/`. Each parallel task gets its own isolated directory, ending the cross-contamination that v2.0.0 hooks introduced by hardcoding `task_plan.md` at the project root. Legacy zero-argument behavior is unchanged. New `set-active-plan.sh` and `set-active-plan.ps1` let users explicitly switch between plans without exporting `PLAN_ID`. New `resolve-plan-dir.sh` and `resolve-plan-dir.ps1` provide the resolution chain: `$PLAN_ID` env var, then `.planning/.active_plan`, then the newest plan directory by mtime, then empty (legacy fallback). All four Codex lifecycle hooks (UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop) now route through the resolver instead of assuming a root-level `task_plan.md`.
- **Codex session isolation** (Issue #146 by @githubYiheng): Codex sessions in a shared working directory no longer receive plan context from unrelated sessions. Attachment is opt-in: create `.planning/sessions/<session_id>.attached` to bind a session to the active plan. `user-prompt-submit.sh`, `pre_tool_use.py`, `stop.py`, and `post_tool_use.py` all gate on session attachment before injecting context or blocking. Backward compatible: absence of `.planning/sessions/` preserves existing single-session behavior.
- **Hermes integration notes** (Issue #147 by @09ashishkapoor): `docs/hermes.md` gains an `Integration Notes` section that separates what the adapter provides today from what is not full parity with hook-native platforms. Covers current support level, recommended integration pattern, and a tradeoffs table. Reduces confusion for users migrating from Claude Code hook workflows.
- **34 new tests**: `tests/test_resolve_plan_dir.py` (7), `tests/test_init_session_slug.py` (6), `tests/test_hook_resolver_integration.py` (10), `tests/test_codex_session_isolation.py` (5), `tests/test_set_active_plan.py` (6).

### Fixed

- **`resolve_latest_dir` skips non-plan directories**: auto-discovery previously matched any subdirectory under `.planning/`, including the new `sessions/` directory. It now requires `task_plan.md` to be present, preventing session isolation from silently breaking when both features are active.
- **`short_uuid()` bypasses Windows App Execution Aliases**: the function now probes each Python candidate with a test run before trusting `command -v`, avoiding the case where the Windows Store alias reports presence but exits non-zero.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.36.0 across 14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `CITATION.cff`
- `CONTRIBUTORS.md` updated: added @githubYiheng (Issue #146), @09ashishkapoor (Issue #147), @shawnli1874 (Issue #148); total count now 39+

### Thanks

- @githubYiheng for tracing the session boundary problem down to its exact code path and proposing the session attachment model (Issue #146)
- @09ashishkapoor for the clear documentation gap report and the four-section structure that made writing the fix straightforward (Issue #147)
- @shawnli1874 for the detailed parallel workflow breakdown, the concrete reproduction case, and the slug naming proposal that shaped the final design (Issue #148)

## [2.35.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **Hermes adapter** (PR #136 by @bailob): new `.hermes/skills/planning-with-files/` bundle, `.hermes/plugins/planning-with-files/` Python adapter, `/plan` and `/plan-status` command wrappers, and `docs/hermes.md` install guide. The adapter registers three tools (`planning_with_files_init`, `planning_with_files_status`, `planning_with_files_check_complete`) plus `pre_llm_call` and `post_tool_call` hooks that mirror the Claude Code hook behavior. Hermes is now platform 17. The PR ships 20 unit tests in `tests/test_hermes_adapter.py` covering status parsing, reminder behavior, installation layout, and completion checks.
- **NLPM audit coverage** (Issue #140 by @xiaolai): static audit of all 25 natural language artifacts, overall score 91/100, zero Critical or High findings. The three verified bugs were filed as separate PRs and merged below.

### Fixed

- **Pi PowerShell session-catchup syntax error** (PR #137 by @xiaolai, closes part of #140): `.pi/skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md` had a missing opening `"` before the script path in the Windows PowerShell invocation, causing a parse error that silently killed session catchup for Pi users on Windows. Quote restored to balance the closing `"`.
- **Session-catchup context injection now bounded** (PR #138 by @xiaolai, closes part of #140): `.github/hooks/scripts/session-start.sh` piped unbounded `session-catchup.py` output into `additionalContext`, meaning content from a prior session (web results, tool output) could reach the current model context unlabeled and without size limit. Output now passes through `head -100` and is prefixed with `[planning-with-files] Previous session context (truncated to 100 lines):` so the model knows the content is historical.
- **Hook scripts prefer known Python paths** (PR #139 by @xiaolai, closes part of #140): `session-start.sh`, `pre-tool-use.sh`, and `error-occurred.sh` resolved the Python interpreter entirely from the user's PATH. The three scripts now try `/usr/bin/python3`, `/usr/local/bin/python3`, and `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3` before falling back to `command -v python3`, closing a PATH hijack vector without changing behavior on systems that expose Python at those canonical paths.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.35.0 across 14 SKILL.md variants, plugin.json, marketplace.json, and CITATION.cff
- `CONTRIBUTORS.md` updated: added @bailob (PR #136, major contribution) and @xiaolai (PRs #137, #138, #139, Issue #140); total count now 36+
- plugin.json description now says "17+ AI coding assistants" and keywords include `hermes`

### Thanks

- @bailob for the Hermes adapter, full test coverage, and the `/plan` and `/plan-status` command wrappers (PR #136)
- @xiaolai for the NLPM audit sweep and three coordinated hardening PRs (PR #137, PR #138, PR #139, Issue #140)

## [2.34.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- **Stop hook portability failure on Windows Git Bash** (closes #133, reported by @nazeshinjite) — Two independent bugs caused the Stop hook to silently fail on Windows 11 with Git Bash inside Command Prompt: (1) `export SD=` was treated as an external command rather than a shell builtin in certain Windows Git Bash invocation contexts, producing `bash: export: No such file or directory`; (2) the fallback path `$HOME/.claude/plugins/planning-with-files` never exists — the actual install location is `~/.claude/plugins/cache/planning-with-files/planning-with-files/VERSION/`. Fixed across all 13 SKILL.md variants (Claude Code, Codex, CodeBuddy, Cursor, Factory, Mastra Code, OpenCode, all language variants). Claude Code variants now use PowerShell self-discovery via `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` with `~` home expansion (no bash variable needed) and a glob-based sh fallback against the correct cache path. All other IDE variants have `export SD=` replaced with `SD=`.

## [2.34.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Codex hooks restored** (closes #132) — `.codex/hooks.json` and `.codex/hooks/` scripts are back. Codex users now get the same full lifecycle hook automation as Claude Code, Cursor, and Copilot users: SessionStart runs session catchup and injects plan context; UserPromptSubmit re-injects on every message; PreToolUse re-reads task_plan.md before Bash; PostToolUse reminds the agent to update progress.md; Stop blocks when phases are incomplete then re-prompts. These files were present in v2.31.0 (PR #120 by @Leon-Algo) but were accidentally wiped when master was rewritten during v2.32.0 — now fully restored.
- **Codex hook regression test** (`tests/test_codex_hooks.py`) — 4 test cases covering hooks.json structure, SessionStart context injection, PreToolUse systemMessage emission, PostToolUse progress reminder, and Stop block-then-allow behavior
- **Tessl skill-review-and-optimize CI** (PR #131 by @popey) — `.github/workflows/skill-review.yml` runs on every PR that touches a SKILL.md, posts scores and AI-suggested improvements as a PR comment; `.github/workflows/skill-optimize-apply.yml` lets contributors type `/apply-optimize` to commit the suggestions directly. Non-blocking by default.

### Fixed

- **Canonical shell scripts not executable** (PR #122 by @Leon-Algo) — `skills/planning-with-files/scripts/check-complete.sh` and `init-session.sh` were tracked as `100644` instead of `100755`, breaking Codex and any Unix installer that depends on the executable bit. Fixed to `100755`. Regression test added.
- **Duplicate `version:` key in Codex SKILL.md** — `.codex/skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md` had two `version: "2.33.0"` entries in the metadata block (same bug fixed for zh/zht in a previous commit but missed here). Deduplicated.
- **Codex docs updated** — `docs/codex.md` rewritten to cover both skills and hooks installation, hooks protocol explanation, workspace vs personal install, and troubleshooting for duplicate hook messages and Windows limitations.

### Changed

- **CONTRIBUTORS.md updated** — Added @Leon-Algo (PRs #119, #120, #122), @YSAA1 (PR #109), @kevinaimonster (PR #108), @wd041216-bit (PR #107); updated @lasmarois entry to include PR #37; bumped total count to 32+

### Thanks

- @Leon-Algo for the Codex hooks design, three separate fix PRs, and patience while the master rewrite wiped his work (PR #119, #120, #122)
- @popey (Alan Pope) for the Tessl CI workflow (PR #131)

## [2.33.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- **Multi-language expansion** — New skill variants for international users:
  - Arabic (`planning-with-files-ar`) - Full Arabic localization with proper RTL support
  - German (`planning-with-files-de`) - Complete German localization  
  - Spanish (`planning-with-files-es`) - Comprehensive Spanish localization
  - Enhanced Simplified Chinese (`planning-with-files-zh`) - Fully localized scripts and templates
  - Enhanced Traditional Chinese (`planning-with-files-zht`) - Refined localization
- **New command files** for all languages: `plan-ar.md`, `plan-de.md`, `plan-es.md`
- **International installation commands** added to README with language-specific examples
- **Global keyword support** in plugin metadata for better discoverability

### Fixed

- **Simplified Chinese script localization** — All scripts now properly display Chinese messages instead of English
- **Arabic template consistency** — Template and scripts now use consistent Arabic phase headers (`### المرحلة`) and state labels (`**الحالة:**`)
- **Spanish template consistency** — Template and scripts now use consistent Spanish state labels (`**Estado:**`)
- **Stop hook path corrections** — All language variants now use correct paths in Stop hooks

## [2.32.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Codex session catchup** (PR #124 by @ebrevdo) — `session-catchup.py` now reads Codex rollout JSONL from `~/.codex/sessions`, prefers `CODEX_THREAD_ID` when skipping the current thread, filters subagent and tiny sessions, and detects planning-file updates from structured Codex `patch_apply_end` events
- **Loaditout security badge** (PR #126, closes #123) — Added A-grade security badge to README (top 20.5% of 20,000+ MCP servers scanned)

### Fixed

- **Stop hook fails on Windows Git Bash (MSYS2)** (PR #126, closes #125)
  - Root cause: MSYS2 treats bare `SD="/c/Users/..."` as a command to execute rather than a variable assignment
  - Fix: changed `SD="..."` to `export SD="..."` across all 9 SKILL.md variants (Claude Code, Codex, CodeBuddy, Cursor, Factory, Gemini, Mastra Code, OpenCode, + zh/zht)

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.32.0 across all 12 SKILL.md files, plugin.json, marketplace.json, and CITATION.cff

### Thanks

- @ebrevdo (Eugene Brevdo) for the Codex session catchup rewrite (PR #124)

## [2.29.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **Analytics workflow template** (PR #115 by @mvanhorn, addresses #103)
  - New `--template analytics` flag on `init-session.sh` and `init-session.ps1`
  - `templates/analytics_task_plan.md` with 4 analytics-specific phases: Data Discovery, Exploratory Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Synthesis
  - `templates/analytics_findings.md` with Data Sources table, Hypothesis Log, Query Results, and Statistical Findings sections
  - Analytics-specific `progress.md` generates a Query Log table instead of Test Results
  - Default behavior unchanged; existing users are not affected

### Usage

```bash
./scripts/init-session.sh --template analytics my-project
```

### Thanks

- @mvanhorn (Matt Van Horn) for implementing the analytics template that @sedlukha requested in #103

---

## [2.28.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- **Traditional Chinese (zh-TW) skill variant** (PR #113 by @waynelee2048)
  - Fully translated SKILL.md, templates, and scripts under `skills/planning-with-files-zht/`
  - Localized hooks, check-complete, init-session, and session-catchup scripts

### Thanks

- @waynelee2048 for the Traditional Chinese translation

---

## [2.27.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- **Kiro Agent Skill support** (PR #112 by @EListenX)
  - Full `.kiro/skills/planning-with-files/` layout with SKILL.md, bootstrap scripts, templates, references
  - Bootstrap creates `.kiro/plan/` for planning files and `.kiro/steering/planning-context.md` with `#[[file:]]` live references
  - Includes session-catchup.py and check-complete scripts adapted for Kiro's `.kiro/plan/` path
  - Replaces the old `.kiro/scripts/` and `.kiro/steering/` approach with proper Agent Skill format

### Changed

- Updated `scripts/sync-ide-folders.py` to skip `.kiro` (Kiro uses its own skill layout)
- Rewrote `docs/kiro.md` to reflect new Agent Skill approach

### Thanks

- @EListenX (Yi Chenxi) for the thorough Kiro integration with proper Agent Skill format

---

## [2.23.0] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed

- **Session catchup not working after `/clear`** (Issue #106 by @tony-stark-eth)
  - Root cause: No hook fired on session start to remind the agent about existing planning files. After `/clear`, the agent started fresh with no awareness of the active plan.
  - Added `UserPromptSubmit` hook across all 7 IDE SKILL.md files. When `task_plan.md` exists, the hook injects a directive to read all three planning files before proceeding. This fires on every user message, ensuring the agent always knows about active plans even after `/clear` or context compaction.
  - Strengthened SKILL.md "FIRST" section: now explicitly says to read all three files immediately, not just run session catchup.

- **Progress not updating consistently** (Issue #106)
  - Root cause: `PostToolUse` hook message only mentioned `task_plan.md`, never `progress.md`. The agent was never reminded to log what it did.
  - Changed PostToolUse message across all 7 IDE SKILL.md files and both Copilot hook scripts to lead with "Update progress.md with what you just did."
  - Added `if [ -f task_plan.md ]` guard so the reminder only fires when a plan is active.

- **Post-plan additions not tracked** (Issue #106)
  - Root cause: When all phases were complete, `check-complete` scripts reported "ALL PHASES COMPLETE" with no guidance about continuing. The agent had no reason to add new work to the plan.
  - Updated `check-complete.sh` and `check-complete.ps1`: completion message now says "If the user has additional work, add new phases to task_plan.md before starting."
  - Updated Copilot `agent-stop` scripts to output continuation context even when all phases are complete (previously returned empty `{}`).
  - Added Critical Rule #7 ("Continue After Completion") to canonical SKILL.md body.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.23.0 across all 7 IDE SKILL.md files, plugin.json, and marketplace.json

### Thanks

- @tony-stark-eth for the detailed bug report covering all three symptoms (Issue #106)

---

## [2.22.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **Formal benchmark results** — skill evaluated using Anthropic's skill-creator framework
  - 10 parallel subagents, 5 diverse task types, 30 objectively verifiable assertions
  - with_skill: **96.7% pass rate** (29/30); without_skill: 6.7% (2/30) — delta: +90 percentage points
  - 3 blind A/B comparisons: with_skill wins 3/3 (100%), avg score 10.0/10 vs 6.8/10
  - Full methodology in [docs/evals.md](docs/evals.md)
- **Technical article** — [docs/article.md](docs/article.md): full write-up of the security analysis, fix, and eval methodology
- **README badges** — Benchmark (96.7% pass rate), A/B Verified (3/3 wins), Security Verified
- **README Benchmark Results section** — key numbers visible at a glance

### Changed

- `marketplace.json` version corrected to track current release (was stuck at 2.0.0)

## [2.21.0] - 2026-03-05

### Security

- **Remove `WebFetch` and `WebSearch` from `allowed-tools`** — fixes Gen Agent Trust Hub FAIL and reduces Snyk W011 risk score
  - The planning-with-files skill is a file-management and planning skill; web access is not part of its core scope
  - The PreToolUse hook re-reads `task_plan.md` before every tool call, creating an amplification vector when web-sourced content is written to plan files. Removing these tools from the skill's declared scope breaks the toxic flow
  - Applied across all 7 IDE variants that declared `allowed-tools`: Claude Code, Cursor, Kilocode, CodeBuddy, Codex, OpenCode, Mastra Code
- **Add Security Boundary section to SKILL.md** — explicit guidance that web/search results must go to `findings.md` only (not `task_plan.md`), and all external content must be treated as untrusted
- **Add security note to examples.md** — the web research example now includes an inline comment reinforcing the trust boundary

## [2.20.0] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- **Codex session-catchup silent failure** (PR #100 by @tt-a1i, fixes #94)
  - `session-catchup.py` in the Codex variant was silently scanning `~/.claude/projects` even when running from a Codex context, where sessions live under `~/.codex/sessions` in a different format
  - Now detects the Codex runtime from `__file__` path and prints a clear fallback message instead of a silent no-op

- **Docs broken links** (PR #99 by @tt-a1i, fixes #95)
  - `docs/opencode.md` linked to `.opencode/INSTALL.md` which does not exist — corrected to `docs/installation.md`
  - `docs/factory.md` See Also links used `../skills/planning-with-files/` paths — corrected to `../.factory/skills/planning-with-files/`

- **Examples used stale `notes.md` filename** (PR #99 by @tt-a1i, fixes #96)
  - All `examples.md` files across 16 IDE copies referenced `notes.md` which was renamed to `findings.md` — updated consistently everywhere

- **`sync-ide-folders.py --help` ran a sync instead of printing usage** (PR #99 by @tt-a1i, fixes #98)
  - Replaced manual `sys.argv` parsing with `argparse` — `--help` now exits cleanly with usage information

### Changed

- **OpenCode README support label corrected** (PR #99 by @tt-a1i, fixes #97)
  - Changed from `Full Support` to `Partial Support` with a note about session catchup limitations — aligns README with what `docs/opencode.md` actually says

### Thanks

- @tt-a1i for the full consistency sweep (PR #99, PR #100)

---

## [2.19.0] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- **Codex Advanced Topics broken links** (PR #92 by @tt-a1i, fixes #91)
  - Corrected two dead links in `.codex/skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md`
  - `reference.md` → `references/reference.md`
  - `examples.md` → `references/examples.md`

### Thanks

- @tt-a1i for identifying and fixing the broken Codex links (PR #92)

---

## [2.18.3] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **Stop hook multiline YAML command fails under Git Bash on Windows** (PR #86 by @raykuo998)
  - Root cause: YAML `command: |` multiline blocks are not reliably parsed by Git Bash on Windows. The shell received the first line (`SCRIPT_DIR=...`) as a command name rather than a variable assignment, crashing the hook before it could do anything.
  - Replaced 25-line OS detection scripts with a single-line implicit platform fallback chain: `powershell.exe` first, `sh` as fallback. Applied to all 7 SKILL.md variants with Stop hooks.
  - Added `-NoProfile` to PowerShell invocation for faster startup

- **`check-complete.ps1` completely failing on PowerShell 5.1** (PR #88 by @raykuo998)
  - Root cause: Special characters inside double-quoted `Write-Host` strings (`[`, `(`, em-dash) caused parse errors in Windows PowerShell 5.1
  - Replaced double-quoted strings with single-quoted strings plus explicit concatenation for variable interpolation. Applied to all 12 platform copies.

### Thanks

- @raykuo998 for both Windows compatibility fixes (PR #86, PR #88)

---

## [2.18.2] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- **Mastra Code hooks were silently doing nothing**
  - Root cause: Mastra Code reads hooks from `.mastracode/hooks.json`, not from SKILL.md frontmatter. The existing integration had hooks defined only in SKILL.md (Claude Code format), which Mastra Code ignores entirely. All three hooks (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop) were non-functional.
  - Added `.mastracode/hooks.json` with proper Mastra Code format including `matcher`, `timeout`, and `description` fields
  - Fixed `MASTRACODE_SKILL_ROOT` env var in SKILL.md Stop hook (variable does not exist in Mastra Code, replaced with `$HOME` fallback to local path)
  - Bumped `.mastracode/skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md` metadata version from 2.16.1 to 2.18.1
  - Corrected `docs/mastra.md` to accurately describe hooks.json (removed false claim that Mastra Code uses the same hook system as Claude Code)
  - Fixed personal installation instructions to include hooks.json copy step

---

## [2.18.1] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- **Copilot hooks garbled characters — still broken after v2.16.1** (Issue #82, confirmed by @Hexiaopi)
  - Root cause: `Get-Content` in all PS1 scripts had no `-Encoding` parameter — PowerShell 5.x reads files using the system ANSI code page (Windows-1252) by default, corrupting any non-ASCII character in `task_plan.md` or `SKILL.md` before it reaches the output pipe. The v2.16.1 fix was correct but fixed only the output side, not the read side.
  - Secondary fix: `[System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8` returns UTF-8 with BOM — replaced with `[System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false)` (UTF-8 without BOM) in all four PS1 scripts to prevent JSON parsers from receiving a stray `0xEF 0xBB 0xBF` preamble
  - Fixed files: `pre-tool-use.ps1`, `session-start.ps1`, `agent-stop.ps1`, `post-tool-use.ps1`
  - Bash scripts were already correct from v2.16.1

### Thanks

- @Hexiaopi for confirming the issue persisted after v2.16.1 (Issue #82)

---

## [2.18.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **BoxLite sandbox runtime integration** (Issue #84 by @DorianZheng)
  - New `docs/boxlite.md` guide for running planning-with-files inside BoxLite micro-VM sandboxes via ClaudeBox
  - New `examples/boxlite/quickstart.py` — working Python example using ClaudeBox's Skill API to inject planning-with-files into a VM
  - New `examples/boxlite/README.md` — example context and requirements
  - README: new "Sandbox Runtimes" section (BoxLite is infrastructure, not an IDE — kept separate from the 16-platform IDE table)
  - README: BoxLite badge and Documentation table entry added
  - BoxLite loads via ClaudeBox (`pip install claudebox`) using its Python Skill object — no `.boxlite/` folder needed

### Thanks

- @DorianZheng for the BoxLite integration proposal (Issue #84)

---

## [2.17.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- **Mastra Code support** — new `.mastracode/skills/planning-with-files/` integration with native hooks (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop), full scripts, templates, and installation guide (platform #16)

### Fixed

- **Skill metadata spec compliance** — applied PR #83 fixes across all 12 IDE-specific SKILL.md files:
  - `allowed-tools` YAML list → comma-separated string (Codex, Cursor, Kilocode, CodeBuddy, OpenCode)
  - `version` moved from top-level to `metadata.version` across all applicable files
  - Description updated with trigger terms ("plan out", "break down", "organize", "track progress") in all IDEs
  - Version bumped to 2.16.1 everywhere, including canonical `skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md`
  - OpenClaw inline JSON metadata expanded to proper block YAML

### Thanks

- @popey for the PR #83 spec fixes that identified the issues

---

## [2.16.1] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **Copilot hooks garbled characters on Windows** (Issue #82, reported by @Hexiaopi)
  - PowerShell scripts now set `$OutputEncoding` and `[Console]::OutputEncoding` to UTF-8 before any output — fixes garbled diamond characters (◆) caused by PowerShell 5.x defaulting to UTF-16LE stdout
  - Bash scripts now use `json.dumps(..., ensure_ascii=False)` — preserves UTF-8 characters (emojis, accented letters, CJK) in `task_plan.md` instead of converting them to raw `XXXX` escape sequences

### Thanks

- @Hexiaopi for reporting the garbled characters issue (Issue #82)

---

## [2.16.0] - 2026-02-22

  - Replaced broken `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` references with correct Codex paths (`~/.codex/skills/planning-with-files/`)
  - Added missing template files to `.codex/skills/planning-with-files/templates/`

### Changed

- **OpenClaw Docs Update** (PR #65 by @AZLabsAI, fixes #64)
  - Renamed `docs/moltbot.md` to `docs/openclaw.md`
  - Updated all paths from `~/.clawdbot/` to `~/.openclaw/`

- @codelyc for Codex path fix (PR #66)
- @AZLabsAI for OpenClaw docs update (PR #65)

---

## [2.11.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added

- **`/plan` Command for Easier Autocomplete** (Issue #39)
  - Added `commands/plan.md` creating `/planning-with-files:plan` command
  - Users can now type `/plan` and see the command in autocomplete
  - Shorter alternative to `/planning-with-files:start`
  - Works immediately after plugin installation - no extra setup required

### Usage

After installing the plugin, you have two command options:

| Command | How to Find | Works Since |

## [2.4.0] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: Fixed SKILL.md frontmatter to comply with official Agent Skills spec** (Issue #39)
  - Removed invalid `hooks:` field from SKILL.md frontmatter (not supported by spec)
  - Removed invalid top-level `version:` field (moved to `metadata.version`)
  - Removed `user-invocable:` field (not in official spec)
  - Changed `allowed-tools:` from YAML list to space-delimited string per spec
  - This fixes `/planning-with-files` slash command not appearing for users

### Changed

- Version now stored in `metadata.version` field
- Removed `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` variable references from SKILL.md (use relative paths)
- Updated plugin.json to v2.4.0

### Technical Details

The previous SKILL.md used non-standard frontmatter fields:
```yaml
# OLD (broken)
version: "2.3.0"           # NOT supported at top level
user-invocable: true       # NOT in official spec
hooks:                     # NOT supported in SKILL.md
  PreToolUse: ...
```

Now uses spec-compliant format:
```yaml
# NEW (fixed)
name: planning-with-files
description: ...
license: MIT
metadata:
  version: "2.4.0"
  author: OthmanAdi
allowed-tools: Read Write Edit Bash Glob Grep WebFetch WebSearch

  - Now templates are accessible regardless of how `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` resolves
  - Works for both plugin installs and manual installs

### Structure

After this fix, templates exist in THREE locations for maximum compatibility:
- `templates/` - At repo root (for `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/`)
- `planning-with-files/templates/` - For plugin marketplace installs
- `skills/planning-with-files/templates/` - For legacy `~/.claude/skills/` installs

### Workaround for Existing Users

If you still experience issues after updating:
1. Uninstall: `/plugin uninstall planning-with-files@planning-with-files`
2. Reinstall: `/plugin marketplace add OthmanAdi/planning-with-files`
3. Install: `/plugin install planning-with-files@planning-with-files`
