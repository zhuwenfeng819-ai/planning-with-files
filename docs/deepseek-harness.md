# DeepSeek Harness Support

planning-with-files treats [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (`dsh`) as a first-class host. Two pieces work together:

- **The skill.** dsh discovers `SKILL.md` files in `<project>/.dsh/skills`, `<project>/.agents/skills`, `~/.dsh/skills` and `~/.agents/skills`, so the workflow instructions load like any other skill, and `/planning-with-files` typed in the composer invokes it.
- **The native plugin** `dsh-planning-with-files`, a Cordis plugin bundle. It subscribes to dsh's lifecycle events to inject the plan on every prompt, remind after writes, re-inject the plan after compaction and hold a gated turn open until the plan reports complete, and it registers `/pwf`, `/pwf-status` and the `pwf_init`, `pwf_status`, `pwf_check` tools. Source: `.dsh/packages/dsh-planning-with-files/` in this repository.

The plugin is built and tested against the published `@deepseek-ai/dsh` 0.1.5-rc.2 and the `@deepseek-ai/*` 0.1.5-rc.2 libraries it installs (Cordis 4.0.2).

## What you get

| Lifecycle point | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `agent/pre-step` | Appends the active plan as one plugin-sourced message to the step that carries your prompt: the framed head of `task_plan.md` (50 lines), the normalized tail of `progress.md` (20 lines), a pointer to `findings.md`. Steps that carry only tool results, steering or the plugin's own messages get nothing (the one exception is the first step after a compaction, below), so the plan arrives once per prompt and never twice after a `/pwf` injection |
| `tools/post-execute` | Attaches the progress reminder as additional context to a successful `write` or `edit` call, and to a `str_replace_editor` call with a `create`, `str_replace` or `insert` command where a profile mounts that tool (none of the shipped 0.1.5-rc.2 profiles does), while a plan exists |
| `session/event` carrying a successful `compaction/end` | Marks the session, and the next step of that agent carries the compaction note (plan pointer, flush instruction, attestation hash) followed by the framed plan as one message, so the continuation resumes at the current phase. Automatic pressure compaction runs inside the compacted turn, so its next step is the continuation; a manual `/compact` runs idle, so the next prompt is. The plan is read at that step, never queued earlier, so it is never stale |
| `agent/turn-stopping` | The completion gate in gated mode (below) |

| Command | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `/pwf [--autonomous\|--gated] [--template analytics] [plan name]` | Creates `task_plan.md`, `findings.md` and `progress.md`. A name creates `.planning/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/` and points `.planning/.active_plan` at it; `--gated` or `--autonomous` writes the v3 markers and attests the plan. The framed plan is queued for the next model request. The handler runs inside dsh without a model round trip and answers with the created files, the plan id and the mode |
| `/pwf-status` | Plan id, mode, attestation state, current phase, phase counts, and any nested plans below the root |

| Tool | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `pwf_init` | Arguments `name`, `mode` (`autonomous` or `gated`), `template` (`default` or `analytics`): the `/pwf` contract for the model, returns a JSON document |
| `pwf_status` | JSON summary of the active plan (id, mode, attestation, current phase, phase counts) |
| `pwf_check` | JSON: whether every phase of the active plan is complete |

Commands and tools resolve the plan from the calling agent's session workspace, exactly like the listeners. `PLANNING_DISABLED=1` and a broken `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` pin answer with an explicit error instead of a silent fallback.

## Install

### 1. The skill

```bash
npx skills add OthmanAdi/planning-with-files --skill planning-with-files -g
```

With `-g` the installer writes `~/.agents/skills/planning-with-files/`, which dsh reads with zero configuration. Without `-g` it writes `./.agents/skills/planning-with-files/` in the current project, which dsh reads as well. dsh honours the frontmatter keys `name`, `description`, `whenToUse`, `metadata`, `disable-model-invocation` and `user-invocable`; the `hooks:` block is a Claude Code convention that dsh ignores, which is exactly why the plugin exists.

Verify:

```bash
ls ~/.agents/skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md
```

### 2. The plugin

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-planning-with-files
```

Restart `dsh web`. `dsh plugin` forwards to pnpm inside the profile directory (`$DSH_HOME/profiles/web`, `~/.dsh/profiles/web` by default), so pnpm must be on PATH. The package ships built code, so the install asks for no build permission. The same command with `--profile headless`, `--profile sdk` or `--profile acp` adds the plugin to those profiles; restart the matching app afterwards.

Verify without booting:

```bash
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

The dump prints a `# == dsh-planning-with-files` layer with the `planning-with-files` row.

Configuration is optional. To keep injection and switch the completion gate off, override the row's `config` in the profile's `cordis.patch.yml` (`$DSH_HOME/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml`). A patch replaces the row's whole `config` value, so restate both keys:

```yaml
- id: planning-with-files
  config:
    enabled: true
    gate: false
```

### 3. First run

Start `dsh web` in a project and type:

```
/pwf My task --gated
```

The command answers with the created files, the plan id (`YYYY-MM-DD-my-task`) and the mode; the next message you send carries the framed plan. `/pwf-status` reports the plan. Asking the model to call `pwf_status` exercises the tool path.

## How plan selection works

Every event resolves the plan again from the session's working directory (the `cwd` on the session header), in this order:

1. `PLAN_ID=<slug>` in the dsh process environment binds one plan. A slug that names no plan ends resolution: nothing is injected, and neither the pointer nor the root plan is used instead.
2. Without `PLAN_ID`, two or more named plans under `.planning/` are ambiguous: the first prompt gets the one-line `Multiple plans are available` notice and nothing is injected until `PLAN_ID` is set. A shared pointer or a directory timestamp cannot tell which plan this session means.
3. With one named plan, `.planning/.active_plan` (BOM tolerant) or the plan directory itself selects it.
4. The legacy `task_plan.md` in the project root.

`PWF_PLAN_ROOT=<absolute path>` pins the project root; a pin that does not resolve to a real directory fails closed. When a direct child project carries its own live plan, a cwd guess is ambiguous: the plugin injects a one-line notice instead of a plan until you pin the session with `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` or `PLAN_ID`. `PLANNING_DISABLED=1` silences every listener, command and tool.

Autonomous and gated plans inject only when `.attestation` (slug plan) or `.plan-attestation` (root plan) matches the SHA-256 of `task_plan.md`; a tampered or unattested v3 plan is refused with a `context blocked` line. `/pwf --gated` and `pwf_init` with `mode: gated` attest the plan they create. After editing the plan, re-attest it (`sh scripts/attest-plan.sh` from the installed skill) or recreate it.

The environment variables are read from the `dsh` process, because the plugin runs inside it: set them before starting `dsh web`, not in a shell inside the session.

## The completion gate

dsh cannot refuse to end a turn, but `agent/turn-stopping` is awaited before the turn closes, and a listener that steers the agent makes the machine run another step. The gate uses that: when a gated plan still has an `in_progress` phase, the plugin steers the agent with the same reason the Claude Code Stop gate prints, and the agent continues. Decision table, shared with `check-complete.sh --gate` and the OpenCode plugin:

1. `<plan-dir>/.mode` contains the `gate` token (`/pwf --gated`, `pwf_init` with `mode: gated`, or `init-session.sh --gated`).
2. An `in_progress` phase exists, counted as the per-field maximum of `**Status:** in_progress` lines and inline `[in_progress]` markers.
3. The block counter `<plan-dir>/.stop_blocks` is below `PWF_GATE_CAP` (default 20).
4. The ledger (`<plan-dir>/ledger-*.jsonl`) advanced since the previous block; a stall releases the turn.

Each block increments the counter and records the ledger size, so the shell gate and the dsh gate share one state. Subagent children are never held: the gate applies to the delegating agent only. This is Tier 2 in the host capability tiers (follow-up inject): the continuation is a new step, not a refusal, and a user who wants the turn to stop can edit the plan, clear the `.mode` file, set `PLANNING_DISABLED=1`, or set `gate: false` on the row.

## What is not covered

- **No per-tool-call recitation.** dsh's `tools/pre-execute` decision carries no context field, so the plan reaches the model once per prompt through `agent/pre-step`. This matches the autonomous-mode injection shape on Claude Code.
- **No session catchup adapter yet.** Automatic recovery reads the planning files on disk; `session-catchup.py` does not open dsh's session store under `~/.dsh/sessions/`.
- **`hooks:` frontmatter.** dsh ignores the `hooks:` block in `SKILL.md`; the plugin is the replacement.
- **dsh's own `/plan`.** That command is dsh plan mode and stays untouched; the plugin registers only `/pwf` and `/pwf-status`.
- **Prompts from other plugins.** Only a step that carries a user-sourced message gets the plan. A turn driven by another plugin's message (a `/goal` round, for example) is a continuation and gets nothing.
- **`agent/session-start` sources.** The published 0.1.5-rc.2 declares `compact` as a possible source but every dispatch site announces `startup` or `resume`, and the 0.1.6 alpha line does the same after folding the field into `agent/created`. The plugin therefore keys the compaction re-injection off the durable `compaction/end` session event, which both lines write, and listens to `agent/session-start` for nothing.

## Windows notes

- Plan paths, `.planning/.active_plan` and the attestation files use Windows paths; a UTF-8 BOM in `.active_plan` (a PowerShell redirect) is tolerated.
- `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` must be an absolute path with a drive letter (`C:\projects\app`); a rootless `\projects\app` and a UNC path are refused.
- `dsh plugin` needs pnpm on PATH (`npm install -g pnpm`).
- Set the environment variables for the `dsh` process, for example `$env:PLAN_ID = "2026-09-17-my-task"; dsh web` in PowerShell.

## Troubleshooting

- **`dsh plugin add` printed missing-peer warnings.** The profile installs no peers on purpose (`autoInstallPeers` is off); the `@deepseek-ai/*` packages resolve from the dsh installation through `$DSH_HOME/profiles/node_modules`. The warnings are harmless.
- **The plugin is missing from `--dump-config`.** `dsh plugin --profile web why dsh-planning-with-files` shows whether pnpm installed it; re-run the `add`. A package without `dsh.bundle` in its `package.json` installs as a plain dependency and activates no layer; the published package declares it.
- **Nothing is injected.** Check `PLANNING_DISABLED`, then `/pwf-status`: no plan, a `context blocked` line (attestation), or the ambiguity notice each name their fix. A `planning-with-files: <point> skipped after an error` warning in the dsh log means the plugin contained an error and the turn proceeded without planning context.
- **Ambiguous plans.** A live plan in a direct child project competes with the cwd plan; pin the session with `PWF_PLAN_ROOT=<absolute path>` or `PLAN_ID=<slug>`.
- **The gate keeps steering.** The cap (`PWF_GATE_CAP`, default 20) and the ledger stall rule bound it; mark the phase complete in `task_plan.md`, remove `.mode`, or set `gate: false` on the row.

## From source (contributors)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files.git
cd planning-with-files/.dsh/packages/dsh-planning-with-files
npm ci && npm run build && npm test
```

To load the checkout into a profile, build it first (a linked checkout has no `dist/` until you do) and link it by absolute path:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add /absolute/path/to/planning-with-files/.dsh/packages/dsh-planning-with-files
```

`src/core.ts` is a byte-identical copy of the OpenCode plugin's core and `tests/test_dsh_plugin_core_parity.py` locks the two together: a fix goes into the OpenCode copy and is copied over.
