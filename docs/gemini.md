# Gemini CLI Setup

This guide explains how to install and use planning-with-files with [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/).

## Prerequisites

- Gemini CLI v0.23 or later
- Agent Skills enabled in settings

## Enable Agent Skills

Agent Skills is an experimental feature. Enable it first:

```bash
# Open settings
gemini /settings

# Search for "Skills" → Toggle "Agent Skills" to true → Press Esc to save
```

Or edit `~/.gemini/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "experimental": {
    "skills": true
  }
}
```

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: The Agent Skills standard path (Recommended since v3.7.0)

Gemini CLI reads the cross-tool `.agents/skills/` layout natively (the alias takes precedence over `.gemini/skills/`), and this repo ships the current, version-locked skill there. Either install route lands the up-to-date skill:

```bash
# via the skills installer (targets Gemini among 70+ agents)
npx skills add OthmanAdi/planning-with-files

# or from GitHub, pointing at the standard layout
gemini skills install https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files --path .agents/skills/planning-with-files
```

The historical `.gemini/skills/` variant in this repo is intentionally version-lagged and kept only for existing installs; new installs should use the standard path above, which is bumped with every release.

### Method 2: Manual Installation (User-level)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files.git

# Copy the current skill from the standard layout to the Gemini skills folder
cp -r planning-with-files/.agents/skills/planning-with-files ~/.gemini/skills/
```

### Method 3: Manual Installation (Workspace-level)

For project-specific installation:

```bash
# In your project directory
mkdir -p .gemini/skills

# Copy the current skill from the standard layout
cp -r /path/to/planning-with-files/.agents/skills/planning-with-files .gemini/skills/
```

## Verify Installation

```bash
# List all skills
gemini skills list

# Should show:
# - planning-with-files: Implements Manus-style file-based planning...
```

Or in an interactive session:

```
/skills list
```

## Skill Discovery Tiers

Skills are loaded from three locations with this precedence:

| Tier | Location | Scope |
|------|----------|-------|
| Workspace | `.gemini/skills/` | Project-specific (highest priority) |
| User | `~/.gemini/skills/` | All projects |
| Extension | Bundled with extensions | Lowest priority |

Higher-precedence locations override lower ones when names conflict.

## Usage

### Automatic Activation

Gemini will automatically detect when to use this skill based on the task description. For complex multi-step tasks, it will prompt you:

```
Gemini wants to activate skill: planning-with-files
Purpose: Implements Manus-style file-based planning for complex tasks
Allow? [y/n]
```

### Manual Activation

You can also manually enable/disable skills:

```
/skills enable planning-with-files
/skills disable planning-with-files
/skills reload
```

## Hooks (v2.26.0)

Gemini CLI supports [hooks](https://geminicli.com/docs/hooks/) — lifecycle events that run shell scripts automatically. This skill ships with a `settings.json` that configures 4 hooks:

| Hook Event | What It Does |
|------------|-------------|
| **SessionStart** | Recovers selected context from project planning files without reading agent session stores |
| **BeforeAgent** | Injects the first 30 lines of `task_plan.md` into the user turn through `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` |
| **AfterTool** | Reminds to update `progress.md` after file changes |
| **SessionEnd** | Reports completion status during shutdown; this is advisory and user-facing only |

Gemini's event-specific output schema matters here: `BeforeAgent` and `AfterTool`
send model context through `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`. `BeforeTool`
is reserved for tool validation/argument rewriting, and `BeforeModel` accepts
request/response overrides rather than an `additionalContext` field.

Local agent session history is not part of automatic startup. Explicit `session-catchup.py --metadata <project>` reads same-project local session records and emits aggregate counts only. Use `--replay` for bounded nonce-framed excerpts. The catchup path contains no network request or upload operation.

### Installing Hooks

Copy the hooks configuration to your project:

```bash
# Copy settings.json (merges with existing settings)
cp /path/to/planning-with-files/.gemini/settings.json .gemini/settings.json

# Copy hook scripts
cp -r /path/to/planning-with-files/.gemini/hooks .gemini/hooks
```

Or for user-level hooks:

```bash
# Copy to user settings (applies to all projects)
cp /path/to/planning-with-files/.gemini/settings.json ~/.gemini/settings.json
cp -r /path/to/planning-with-files/.gemini/hooks ~/.gemini/hooks
```

> **Note:** If you already have a `settings.json`, merge the `"hooks"` key manually.

---

## How It Works

1. **Session Start**: Gemini loads skill names and descriptions, hooks run session recovery
2. **Task Detection**: When you describe a complex task, Gemini matches it to the skill
3. **Activation Prompt**: You approve the skill activation
4. **Instructions Loaded**: Full SKILL.md content is added to context
5. **Execution**: BeforeAgent re-injects `task_plan.md` context each user turn; AfterTool reminds the agent to record progress after file changes

## Sharing Skills with Claude Code

If you use both Gemini CLI and Claude Code, you can share skills:

```bash
# Create symlink (Linux/macOS)
ln -s ~/.claude/skills ~/.gemini/skills

# Or copy between them
cp -r ~/.claude/skills/planning-with-files ~/.gemini/skills/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Skill not appearing

1. Check skills are enabled: `gemini /settings` → Search "Skills"
2. Verify installation: `gemini skills list`
3. Reload skills: `/skills reload`

### Skill not activating

- Make sure your task description matches the skill's purpose
- Try manually enabling: `/skills enable planning-with-files`

### Path issues on Windows

Use PowerShell:

```powershell
# Copy to user skills
Copy-Item -Recurse -Path ".\.gemini\skills\planning-with-files" -Destination "$env:USERPROFILE\.gemini\skills\"
```
