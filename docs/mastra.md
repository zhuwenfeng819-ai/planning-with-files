# Mastra Code Setup

Using planning-with-files with [Mastra Code](https://code.mastra.ai/).

---

## Overview

Mastra Code auto-discovers skills from `.mastracode/skills/` directories. It also has built-in Claude Code compatibility, so it reads `.claude/skills/` too — but the dedicated `.mastracode/` integration gives you native hooks support.

## Installation

### Method 1: Workspace Installation (Recommended)

Share the skill with your entire team by adding it to your repository:

```bash
# In your project repository
git clone https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files.git /tmp/planning-with-files

# Copy the Mastra Code skill to your repo
cp -r /tmp/planning-with-files/.mastracode .

# Commit to share with team
git add .mastracode/
git commit -m "Add planning-with-files skill for Mastra Code"
git push

# Clean up
rm -rf /tmp/planning-with-files
```

Now everyone on your team using Mastra Code will have access to the skill.

### Method 2: Personal Installation

Install just for yourself:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files.git /tmp/planning-with-files

# Copy skill to your personal Mastra Code skills folder
mkdir -p ~/.mastracode/skills
cp -r /tmp/planning-with-files/.mastracode/skills/planning-with-files ~/.mastracode/skills/

# Copy hooks (required for plan enforcement)
# If you already have ~/.mastracode/hooks.json, merge the entries manually
cp /tmp/planning-with-files/.mastracode/hooks.json ~/.mastracode/hooks.json

# Clean up
rm -rf /tmp/planning-with-files
```

> **Note:** If you already have a `~/.mastracode/hooks.json`, do not overwrite it. Instead, merge the PreToolUse, PostToolUse, and Stop entries from the skill's hooks.json into your existing file.

### Verification

```bash
ls -la ~/.mastracode/skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md
```

Restart your Mastra Code session. The skill auto-activates when you work on complex tasks.

## How It Works

### Hooks (via hooks.json)

Mastra Code uses a separate `hooks.json` file for lifecycle hooks. This is different from Claude Code, which defines hooks in SKILL.md frontmatter. Mastra Code reads hooks from:

1. `.mastracode/hooks.json` (project-level, highest priority)
2. `~/.mastracode/hooks.json` (global)

This integration includes a pre-configured `hooks.json` with all three hooks:

| Hook | Matcher | What It Does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **PreToolUse** | Write, Edit, Bash, Read, Glob, Grep | Reads first 30 lines of `task_plan.md` to keep goals in attention |
| **PostToolUse** | Write, Edit | Reminds you to update plan status after file changes |
| **Stop** | (all) | Runs `check-complete.sh` to verify all phases are done |

### Auto-Activation

The skill activates when you:
- Mention "complex task" or "multi-step project"
- Ask to "plan out" or "break down" work
- Request help organizing or tracking progress
- Start research tasks requiring >5 tool calls

### The Three Files

Once activated, the skill creates:

| File | Purpose | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| `task_plan.md` | Phases, progress, decisions | Your project root |
| `findings.md` | Research, discoveries | Your project root |
| `progress.md` | Session log, test results | Your project root |

---

## Claude Code Compatibility

Mastra Code reads from `.claude/skills/` as a fallback. If you already have planning-with-files installed for Claude Code, it will work — but the dedicated `.mastracode/` installation gives you:

- Native hooks via `hooks.json` (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop)
- Correct script path resolution for Mastra Code directories
- No path conflicts with Claude Code plugin root

---

## Session Recovery

When your context fills up and you run `/clear`, the skill restores selected context from project planning files. Automatic recovery does not inspect Mastra or other host transcript stores. Local session records are available only through the explicit commands below.

Run manually:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
python3 ~/.mastracode/skills/planning-with-files/scripts/session-catchup.py --metadata "$(pwd)"
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
python "$env:USERPROFILE\.mastracode\skills\planning-with-files\scripts\session-catchup.py" --metadata (Get-Location)
```

These explicit commands read same-project local session records and emit aggregate counts only. Use `--replay` only for a deliberate bounded nonce-framed replay. Bare invocation and automatic hooks do not inspect agent session stores.

## Team Workflow

### Workspace Skills (Recommended)

With workspace installation (`.mastracode/skills/`):
- Everyone on team has the skill
- Consistent planning across projects
- Version controlled with your repo
- Changes sync via git

### Personal Skills

With personal installation (`~/.mastracode/skills/`):
- Use across all your projects
- Keep it even if you switch teams
- Not shared with teammates

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Activating?

1. Verify the file exists: `ls ~/.mastracode/skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md`
2. Restart Mastra Code — skills are scanned on startup
3. Use trigger phrases: "plan out", "break down", "organize", "track progress"

### Hooks Not Running?

Mastra Code reads hooks from `hooks.json`, not from SKILL.md frontmatter. Verify:

1. Check that `.mastracode/hooks.json` exists in your project root (workspace install) or `~/.mastracode/hooks.json` (personal install)
2. Verify the file contains PreToolUse, PostToolUse, and Stop entries
3. Restart Mastra Code after adding or modifying hooks.json

### Already Using Claude Code?

No conflict. Mastra Code checks `.mastracode/skills/` first, then falls back to `.claude/skills/`. You can have both installed.
