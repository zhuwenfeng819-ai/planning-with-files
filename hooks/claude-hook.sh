# Everything below this block answers an event by running resolve-plan-dir.sh
# and inject-plan.sh, and those answer by forking: realpath, stat, sha256sum,
# awk, tr, mktemp, head, tail, sed, wc, four Python starts, and a $(...)
# around most of them. A UserPromptSubmit fire forks about 130 times. On Linux
# and macOS a fork costs one to three milliseconds. Under Git Bash on Windows
# it costs about 90 ms, so the same fire took seven to twelve seconds against
# the 10 s hook timeout: Claude Code discarded the output, the plan never
# reached the model, and every Bash, Read, Grep and Edit call waited five
# more seconds in PreToolUse first.
#
# scripts/inject-plan.py is a byte-identical twin of the chain below
# (tests/test_inject_plan_python_parity.py proves it against this file and
# inject-plan.sh on every CI leg). When a CPython 3 is on PATH the event runs
# there in one process. The twin exits 0 only when its stdout is the complete
# answer; any other status, including an interpreter that cannot run it, falls
# through to the reference chain below unchanged. PWF_FAST_PATH=0 forces the
# reference chain. The Stop event never takes the fast path because it must
# forward Claude's stdin payload to gate-stop.sh.
#
# The PATH walk below is pure shell on purpose: `$(command -v python3)` is
# itself a fork, and the whole point of this block is to spend none. The
# Microsoft Store python.exe/python3.exe aliases are skipped by path: they are
# discoverable on PATH yet refuse to run a script. python3 is preferred over
# python across the whole PATH so an old distro's Python 2 `python` is never
# tried while a python3 exists further down.

# that directory is shared project state and a per-session throttle file does
# not belong in a repo. Cache root and key derivation are deliberately the same
# shape inject-plan.sh already uses for its SHA and progress-guard slots, so
# the marker inherits the same cwd-invariance (#212). If no cache root can be
# created the throttle is skipped rather than the nudge suppressed, which keeps
