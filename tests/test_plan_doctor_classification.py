"""plan-doctor.sh classifies injection output structurally, not by substring (#236).

The injection `case` block matched control strings against `$OUT`, which
carries the plan body VERBATIM inside the `===BEGIN-PWF-DATA===` fences. Two
defects followed:

  1. False WARN. A plan whose phase line read "fix the false PLAN TAMPERED
     warning in plan-doctor" reported a hash mismatch while being correctly
     attested. Not avoidable by correct usage: no documentation reserves those
     phrases.
  2. False PASS. The `PWF_PLAN_ROOT` arm matched
     "PWF_PLAN_ROOT is not a directory", which is not a substring of what
     inject-plan.sh emits. The arm was dead code, execution fell to the
     success arm, and a fully dark-hooks state reported PASS with the refusal
     notice's own byte count. The file's adjacent comment already warned that
     "reporting its byte count as PASS told a dark user their hooks were fine".

Classification now branches on the frame first: every refusal path exits before
frame_file runs, so a frame proves injection happened, and output without one
is by construction a notice. The default arm therefore WARNS, which is what
makes a future literal drift degrade to a noisy warning instead of a silent
PASS. Arm 2 below is the test that would have caught defect 1; arm 3 is the one
that would have caught defect 2; the stub test pins the drift property itself.

### Phase 1
- [ ] fix the false PLAN TAMPERED warning in plan-doctor
- [ ] audit the v3 mode requires attested plan branch
- [ ] document what Session isolation is armed means
- [ ] reword the Ambiguous plan notice
- [ ] check PWF_PLAN_ROOT is not a supported absolute local directory wording
- [ ] and PLAN_ID does not name a plan directory too
