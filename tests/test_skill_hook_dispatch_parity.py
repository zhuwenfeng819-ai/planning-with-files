"""Hook-dispatch parity across every hooks-bearing SKILL.md (issue #212).

Through v2.43 the UserPromptSubmit / PreToolUse / PreCompact hook bodies were
giant inline sh scalars embedded in the SKILL.md frontmatter. v3 moved that
logic into scripts/inject-plan.sh and reduced the canonical scalars to thin
self-discovery dispatchers — but only the canonical file and the .agents mirror
were converted. The eleven other hook-bearing variants (six IDE mirrors plus
five language variants) kept the frozen v2.43 inline body, so every fix that
landed in inject-plan.sh after the split silently never reached users who
installed one of those variants. The reporter of #212 installed .codex and got
a "fixed" bug.

The first conversion of those eleven used ``ls a b c | head -1`` for discovery.
Adversarial review found three silent-failure holes in it:

  1. ``ls | head -1`` SORTS its output, so with several copies installed the
     alphabetically-first path won (the .claude marketplace copy) instead of
     the documented priority order. Fixed: a POSIX first-match-wins loop
     (``for c in ...; do [ -f "$c" ] && { SH="$c"; break; }; done``).
  2. Workspace installs (the RECOMMENDED method for CodeBuddy/Factory, the
     only documented method for Cursor) resolve to nothing: no candidate is
     project-local, deliberately (a repo-relative candidate would let any
     cloned repo plant the script the hook executes). Fixed: the opt-in
     ``PWF_SCRIPT_DIR`` escape hatch is the FIRST candidate — the user sets it
     once, pointing at the skill's scripts dir.
  3. Nothing installed = total silence. Fixed: the UserPromptSubmit scalar
     emits exactly one not-found notice; PreToolUse/PreCompact (fire per tool
     call) and Stop (carries no plan body) deliberately stay silent.

This test makes those regressions impossible to reintroduce: every tracked
SKILL.md that declares a hooks: frontmatter block must dispatch all lifecycle
hooks to skill-hook.sh, must not inline the resolution body, must not
reference the insecure /tmp SHA cache, must carry the documented per-host
discovery candidates, and must actually ship (or be scheduled to receive via
scripts/sync-ide-folders.py) the scripts the dispatch resolves to.

Discovery-path security invariant: candidates may live only under $HOME or an
env-var anchor the user/host controls (${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}, ${PWF_SCRIPT_DIR},
${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}). A project-relative candidate such as
./scripts/inject-plan.sh would let any cloned repository plant a script that
the hooks then execute — that class is asserted away here.
